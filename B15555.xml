            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:176897:3"/>defend the same: I affect not singularity; occasion putting me vpon the work, I trace the same way. My burthen is <hi>Balme from Gile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, Remedies and prescripts for all diseases, especially the Plague:</hi> Whither should I goe with it, but vnto this renowned <hi>Cittie?</hi> It was composed in this <hi>Cittie,</hi> and first vented in this <hi>Cittie,</hi> mine owne habitation and Ministrie is yet bounded by this <hi>Cittie:</hi> the principall distressed part of this <hi>Land</hi> was, and is ordinarily (as populous places vse to bee)
<pb facs="tcp:176897:3"/>this <hi>Cittie;</hi> from hence as the euill was, remedy may be dispatched to other parts (being first here approued.) I am not ignorant, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this <hi>Cittie</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> approued <hi>Doctors,</hi> haue in their seuerall stations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>Balmes,</hi> and might of the same <hi>simples</hi> or <hi>Text,</hi> furnish both this <hi>Cittie</hi> and <hi>Land:</hi> and yet am not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. This is what I could in that straight of time, a part of my labours, amidst many publique and priuate distractions, (mine whole Family being smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb facs="tcp:176897:4"/>(though not with that hand) this may put vs in minde of our great trouble; <hi>Gods</hi> mercifull deliuerance from that trouble, and our proportioned duty vnto <hi>GOD</hi> (when as all may bee forgotten) speaking of all, to vs and our Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>It hath made choyse of your <hi>Patronage, Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, &amp;c.</hi> the weale of this <hi>Cittie,</hi> is (vnder his <hi>Maiestie</hi>) committed vnto your vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie, you haue good skill and great experience of that euill, and this remedy: You

Experienced <hi>Physitians</hi> were now enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to draw out old experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And although these may bee (as the <hi>Physitians</hi> prescripts were) out of date, when as that euill shall bee ouer; yet it will not be safe
<pb facs="tcp:176897:5"/>in such a time to be wholy to seeke. Besides, who knoweth how soone the same hand may send it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? And as yet some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions remaine of it in diuers parts of this Land; on whom <hi>GOD</hi> looke in mercie. Adde yet, this <hi>Balme</hi> is a <hi>Catholicon,</hi> a Salue for euery sore; the trembling Ague as well as the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plague, and of daily vse: in these names doth it call vpon all; especially your <hi>Honour, &amp;c.</hi> for Patronage.</p>
            <p>I cannot but visite and mention you my <hi>kinde</hi> and

            <p>Dr. <hi>Westfield</hi> and M. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Gippes</hi> (as long louing friends, I ioyne you toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the tye may bee the surer to each other, and my selfe:) Gratitude requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it.</p>
            <p>You, Dr. <hi>Westfield;</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of many kindnesses receiued: by you was the foundation of my small pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of knowledge in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things (vnder God) laid; whilst as, an hearer, I sat at your feete: I freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:176897:6"/>your furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to, and care of mee in the Vniuersity, direction in studies, cost, encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, setting me a worke first, when as I was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in tirocinio;</hi> and constant curtesies. If I haue failed in composition, you can and will point it mee out: If I haue taught the truth, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion not your <hi>Patronage:</hi> If you owne it, many others will for your sake &amp; name, which is, and O that it may be euer precious.</p>
            <p>You, Mr. <hi>Thomas Gippes,</hi> by whom the Lord, tooke
<pb facs="tcp:176897:6"/>me vp; without your good will, loue, and leaue, I had not beene an <hi>Academick:</hi> by it I went vnto the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and was maintained almost wholy there: I liued since in your house. In a word, I haue and doe still finde you a Father. I cannot but particularly name you. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude bindeth me to much more: I would encourage you and others liuing, by your example to workes of that nature.</p>
            <p>And you, Mr <hi>Abraham Colfe,</hi> the place I fill is yours.
<pb facs="tcp:176897:7"/>It is as mine account; you are my common shelter: Your great loue vnto mee, vnto your Parish; good men and Gods truth, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a mention.</p>
            <p>Finally, my <hi>Worshipfull</hi> and <hi>louing Parishioners,</hi> you; Though the Doctrine was generall, mine application was vnto you: Some of you were not present, such as heard may safely reade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: I spake then, and write now, for your profit.</p>
            <p>I haue freely reprooued <hi>sinne;</hi> were they not that <hi>cause?</hi> Am I not a <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:176897:7"/>could I but see them, and their fruit, the <hi>Plague?</hi> Was it not in the middest of vs? How narrowly did we escape? Was it not time to crie? Who thought ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day I should speake, or he heare more? It is Gods Ordinance to repentance, and so the saluation of my selfe, and you that heard me also.</p>
            <p>Amongst other sinnes, I much smite at the neglect of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sabbath.</hi> My purpose, doctrine, and practise, is not <hi>Iewish.</hi> I respect &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb facs="tcp:176897:8"/>the doctrine of <hi>our Church,</hi> in those contemned (by such as know them not) <hi>Homilies:</hi> The rule I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the <hi>fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi> one of the <hi>tenne words, Gods immutable and eternall Law,</hi> &amp; would vrge nothing but what is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable.</p>
            <p>If you <hi>Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull,</hi> and my <hi>louing friends,</hi> in your places, shall approue of this <hi>Balme, quatenùs e narthesio sacro</hi> (if any question it, trie it, bring it to the Scriptures, the <hi>onely Canon and rule;</hi> doe but pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise

I hope it shall doe Gods people much good, It shall bee sauorie to their temporall, and eternall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; Our <hi>great God</hi> shall haue his <hi>glorie,</hi> I mine end.

You haue yet bills of thousands cut off <hi>An.</hi> 1603. in this Citie for <hi>sinne.</hi> Bills now to the eyes, and Bells vnto the eare (to omitt other testimonies of sense) declare this truth, that the Plague is the wages of <hi>Sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 And last of all,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>5</label> when as <hi>Death</hi> it selfe, <hi>and all curses</hi> are the fruits and returne of sinne:
<note place="margin">Rom. 6. vlt.</note>
                  <hi>The wages of sinne is death. Cursed is euery one that abideth not in all: all these curses shall come vpon thee, and ouertake thee.</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:176897:16"/>The Pestilence being of that nature must necessarily be an effect of sin; and so the Propositon is cleare, that That which mooueth the Lord to send the Pestilence amongst a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is Sinne.</p>
               <p>Euery sinne is a cause of this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, as we haue seene: and yet for our farther edification it shall not be amisse, from the generall to descend vnto particulars, and to inquire into <hi>the particular sinnes</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Plague: which we shall find out, if we consider, to what sinnes God doth threaten this iudgement: for what sinnes hee hath heretofore executed it; and so argue from a paritie of reason.</p>
               <p>Two sorts of sinnes I finde cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Pestilence, <hi>O missions</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects sometimes, sometimes <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongst <hi>Omissions,</hi> 1. I finde a mouing cause, <hi>want of Sacrifice;</hi> This <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> imply, when as going vnto <hi>Pharao</hi> to intreat that <hi>Israel</hi> might goe, that they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:176897:17"/>might Sacrifice vnto the Lord their God. Their inducement is, <hi>lest hee fall vpon vs with the Pestilence.</hi> Wherein we may vnderstand, that <hi>Omission</hi> of sacrifices of God, layeth a People open vnto the iudgements of God, to Gods falling vpon a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the Pestilence.</p>
               <p>By a paritie of reason, wee may gather that omission of any sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes prescribed vs by the Lord, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man lyable to this Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, the Plague.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Want of <hi>humiliation,</hi> and <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, seeking of Gods fauour,</hi> and <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> is another cause; and this is layde downe in this place: for if the performance of these, in Gods maner, be a meanes of the remedie and cure of a Land, the want of these must bee a cause of the euill. Of which particularly (God willing) hereafter in their seuerall places.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Another defect is, in profit by former mercies or Iudgements, the intent of the Lord in our chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is <hi>amendment,</hi> the Lord doth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:176897:17"/>it for our profit:
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> as a Father he vseth first one, and lesse after, more and greater blowes: when as fewe and lesse iudgements worke not, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile not, more, and greater must follow; amongst other, this of the pestilence: Thus doth the Lord say and doe, <hi>Seuen times so many plagues more,</hi> amongst them the pestilence: <hi>If you wil not be reformed by these, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leu. 26.23.25.</note>
                  <hi>J will send the Pestilence amongst you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Vnto these, adde the want of zeale; the <hi>Zeale of the Lord</hi> in all men in their places, and it expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in loue of goodnesse and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of that which is euill. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> the sonne of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Priest, (saith the Lord, in a time of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence) <hi>hath turned away my wrath from the children of Israel, whilst hee was zealous for my sake:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 25.11.13.</note>
                  <hi>He was zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for his God:</hi> Whence I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably argue, if zeale be a cause and meanes of staying the wrath of the Lord, then zeale and its effects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wanting, cause the wrath of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:176897:18"/>Lord: this particular effect of it the Pestilence: the continuance of the Plague is clearely an effect, and the principles nourishing are the same, with those which cause a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease. That which is spoken of the zeale of <hi>Phineas</hi> is true, of others in their places, of <hi>Ministers, especially Magistrates.</hi> Indeede when as the Magistrate, the man whom God so honoureth, as to giue him his name, <hi>J said yee are Gods,</hi> and place to (<hi>for the iudgement is for God;</hi> they are as God) is not a terrour vnto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, shall conniue and winke at im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, haue an hand in, I, be the first in transgression; It is time for the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe, for the preseruation of the sound parts, yea for his owne <hi>name,</hi> to looke vnto the matter, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise; to send som extraordinary Iudge or Executioner: when as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate doth not, it is time for the principall to keepe an Assise, and there is no <hi>Messenger</hi> more ready or speedy, or impartiall in execution then this, the Pestilence: by this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:176897:18"/>God can quickly visite a person, a Family, a Parish, a Citie, a Land: he can c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5 Hither-vnto referre want of obseruation of Gods <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> which amongst other causes, is rightly obserued by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as in the late Seruice-book for time of this Visitation. Amongst the causes for which GOD visited <hi>Israel</hi> in the wildernesse (one Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being the Pestilence, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.37.) I finde one, the <hi>pollution of Gods Sabbaths. Ezech.</hi> 20 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t is, what the Lord plainely minaceth against that sin, as you may see, <hi>Leu.</hi> 26.3. and 25. compared together.</p>
               <p>Indeede, wheresoeuer there is a want of hallowing Gods Sabbath, or the Lords day: there must needes be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:176897:19"/>a want of spirituall <hi>Sacrifices</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it being the speciall time and season of those Sacrifices: and in that name a cause of the Plague: The want of santifying Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, is an euidence of want of <hi>zeale,</hi> the zeale that was in holy <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Neh.</hi> 13.22. and where there is a want of zeale, there is a sufficient cause of the Plague; and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and sinne, are very congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for all persons and places doe owe vnto the Lord a rest: and where it is not payed,
<note place="margin">Leu. 26.</note> God threatneth <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,</hi> and hath executed the same on <hi>Israel,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. and that for this end, that <hi>the Land might enioy her rest.</hi> Now what fitter iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to execute this vengeance, written, desolation, then the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: it causeth houses to <hi>spue</hi> out Inhabitants: it maketh our congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations thin, and our Streetes thin: it maketh men to forsake all by flight, or death, as we now begin to see in this <hi>Citie.</hi> And therefore:</p>
               <p>Last of all, want of cōming to the

                  <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or at least with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, complement, and quality required by the Lord, is another cause of the Pestilence; as is also obserued in the said booke:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note>
                  <hi>For this cause (saith the Apostle Paul) some of you are sicke, some of you weake, some a sleepe:</hi> Though the disease be not specified, yet there is a likenesse of reason betweene this and any other sicknesse whatsoeuer in this respect. And thus haue we now the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sinnes, causing the Pestilence, vnder that head, Omissions.</p>
               <p>Vnto these adde positiue sinnes or <hi>commissions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Pride and vaine confidence in man,</hi> the arme of flesh. This was King <hi>Dauids</hi> sinne: mouing him to number the people: therefore the Lord smote with this Plague 70. thousand men: a proportioned pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment vnto the sinne destroying, other Gods trusted in, with whom <hi>Dauid</hi> was vainly lifted vp.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Cruelty,</hi> &amp; oppression of those that are vnder of whatsoeuer sort:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:176897:20"/>
                  <hi>Grinding the faces of the poore, &amp;c.</hi> when as in <hi>Israel</hi> they did not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto the Lord in proclaiming liberty to their brethren and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
<note place="margin">Ier. 34.17.</note> the Lord was wrath with <hi>Israel, and behold, I proclaime liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for you</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>to the sword and to the Pestilence.</hi> Cruell men are <hi>mercilesse men:</hi> and when God sendeth the Pestilence on such, hee executeth vengeance <hi>without mercie:</hi> he vseth a mercilesse disease in sundry respects.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Whoredome</hi> is another cause of the Pestilence. <hi>Spiritual</hi> whoredom, and <hi>corporall</hi> whoredome.

                  <hi>Being called to the Sacrifices of their Gods,</hi> it is said, the people did <hi>eate and bowe to their Gods.

               </p>
               <p>Finally, <hi>Oathes</hi> and <hi>Cursings</hi> are a cause of the Plague, <hi>Because of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:176897:21"/>Oathes the Land doth mourne, saith the Prophet.</hi> When doth a Land mourne, if not when it is smitten with the plague? And what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, when as one ordinarie curse in mens mouthes, of all sorts, is, as the <hi>Pox:</hi> so the <hi>Plague,</hi> it is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous thing with the Lord, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to heare and answer in kinde, and to measure vnto man what hee so commonly measureth to others by his mouth, destruction by the plague.</p>
               <p>But what stand I vpon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars? the plague is the flux of euery sinne, as we haue heard: there is no man that hath that sore in his heart, or bosome, but hath a cause in act, which is the mouer of the Lord, to send this fearefull messenger to his destruction, the plague.</p>
               <p>If sinne bee the cause,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> how is it that in this time of the pestilence <hi>any sinner</hi> escapeth, that all are not cut off?</p>
               <p>This question may be made here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Answer. </seg>
                  </label> who knoweth whether any
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:176897:21"/>man shall escape? If the Lord goeth on as he beginneth, there will be no occasion of this question: and yet if any be spared, it will be the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, patience, and long suffering of the Lord. It is the mercie of the Lord, that we haue not beene alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die consumed.</p>
               <p>Particularly, there are causes why in such times the Lord spareth euen the wicked.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Lord can put the wicked man to some good vse. 1. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them <hi>a fence</hi> to Gods Church, who are <hi>fewe,</hi> who are but a <hi>little flocke:</hi> sometimes against the beasts of the field: sometimes against men, to men beasts, to the Church worse, such as would destroy Gods Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeard. 2. They proclaime the great <hi>patience &amp; long suffering</hi> of the <hi>Lord.</hi> 3. They set forth Gods great <hi>power,</hi> which is then seene, when as hee shall rule and dispose of all in his manner, in the middest of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. 4. They exercise all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods spirit in his people, as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:176897:22"/>I could particularly shew. And so further (though they thinke not of it) their saluation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The <hi>Lord</hi> hath <hi>many</hi> more Iudgements besides the plague, and is not bounded: and the plague is his messenger, which hee can send againe at his pleasure; if not this weeke, the next; many yeares after.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Euery wicked man is alwayes in all places Gods prisoner, as a dogge in an halter: when hee will, and how he will; he can execute his vengeance written.</p>
               <p n="4">4 It may be God hath a <hi>purpose</hi> to call him, and that houre is not come as yet: <hi>All that are giuen mee of my Father, shall come vnto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 It may be God hath a purpose eternally to destroy a man: he shall haue life and pleasures here, his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hereafter. Where the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman hath an hope of fruit, hee pruneth those trees, and loppeth su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous boughes, where hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth the fire, hee suffereth those
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:176897:22"/>trees to grow: when as the Grasier putteth his Oxe so the fattest pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, he intendeth, and it shall not be long before there come a day of slaughter: as long as a wicked man goeth on vnsmitten for sinne, hee doth but <hi>heape vp wrath against a day of wrath:</hi> he doth but with the Oxe feede, and fat himselfe against <hi>a day of slaughter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 Last of all, the Lord intendeth to make them without Apologie in the day of Iudgement, they shall haue not a word to speake for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: and then is the vttermost day of account and reckoning: and for these causes, the Lord in times of the pestilence doth not cut off, &amp; sweep away all wicked men.</p>
               <p>Let vs now make some vse of this proposition: and first,</p>
               <p n="1">1 It may be vnto vs a ground of information in the vndoubted cause of the pestilence:

               <p>And the plague of God, as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and all fearefull Oathes are in many a mans mouth: what sinne is there, but it is amongst vs, in this <hi>Land?</hi> and if you will receiue it, these are the causes which haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, or moued the Lord to send a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs the plague.</p>
               <p>And as it sheweth the cause, so those vnto whom this is to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: some giue it vnto the poore, some vnto this man, others to that, if thou wilt not misse the marke: thou must giue it to those men that liue in their sinnes; the particular sinnes spoken of: these are the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans</hi> which trouble <hi>Jsrael,</hi> to whom we must impute it.</p>

The best preseruatiues against the plague, are preseruatiues against sinne: The best remedies for the plague, are such as cure the sores in the soule of man, his sinne: And vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground are wee called on to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:176897:25"/>finde out those preseruatiues, and carefully to vse them. If a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to knowe what these are, and where to be had. My answer is, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>in Iesus Christ. It is a faythfull saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Iesus Christ came into the world to saue sinners.</hi> He is the alone <hi>Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> an <hi>horne of saluation, perfectly able to saue all those that come vnto him. There is no other Name giuen vnder heauen whereby a man may bee saued;</hi> He is <hi>the Sonne of righteousnesse, there is healing in his wings, in him there is circumcision not made with hands, to the putting away the body of the sinnes of the flesh, in him redemption, and remission of sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you demand how a man may attaine it? I answere, by <hi>faith in Christ.</hi> By faith in Christ, receiuing, apprehending, accepting him offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and giuen, <hi>wee receiue remission of sinnes, sanctification, saluation,</hi> and so are all these giuen vnto faith in <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> If you demand when that offer is made, and is to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:176897:26"/>I answer, in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent attention vnto it ministration, in the promises of God, Christ and all his benefits are <hi>lapt vp.</hi> And thus the Gospell is the <hi>power of God to saluation:</hi> and the <hi>pleasure of God is by the foolishnesse of preaching to saue them that beleeue. Christ Iesus is</hi> the <hi>Fountaine</hi> opened for <hi>sinne and vncleanenes,</hi> &amp; therefore are we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>come vnto the water, to wash vs, to make vs cleane:</hi> and by faith in him both wayes, <hi>to put away the euill of our doings out of Gods sight. Hee dyed for our sinnes, he is risen, ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, exalted a Sauiour, and a Prince, to giue repentance and remission of sinnes. If any man sinne, wee haue an Aduocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the Just.</hi> The cure of the Plague, is by taking away the cause, Sinne; the taking away of sinne, is by beleeuing in Christ. <hi>Beholding</hi> by the eye of Faith, <hi>the Lambe of God that taketh away the Sinne of the World.</hi> This is the onely meanes and remedy against sinne, and aboue all other

               <p>It is the more difficult, last of all,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:176897:28"/>because the reason may bee, and is, sometimes the sinne of some other, primarily respected by God in this hand; the sore in the bosome of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may be a sufficient cause, and yet that which is in an other the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: For the sinne of a <hi>Father,</hi> God doth threaten, and answerably <hi>visit</hi> a childe: and there is a case wherein the <hi>sinne of the Mother is not blotted out.</hi> There are sinnes which make a <hi>Land</hi> mourne, and will make it <hi>desolate:</hi> there are sinnes in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke persons, as <hi>Dauid,</hi> as in the head; the whole body may bee the worse, for the euill of the head.

               <p>Last of all, this sheweth vs the odiousnesse and vglinesse of sinne, of all sinnes, the sinnes spoken of causing the Plague, and ought to be a preuailing cause of auersion and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:176897:29"/>opposition vnto it in all men. It is sufficient, I suppose, when as our Proposition saith, it is the proper cause of the Plague.

               <p>Indeede, suppose it be sent but to a Citie, as <hi>London</hi> is, yet it will be found the euill of the <hi>Land:</hi> the whole is as a body, and <hi>London</hi> will be found either as the head, or some other member; if it were but as a finger or toe, it is a part: and euen as the sanitie or strength of euery part in our naturall body, is a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on the whole, of the eye, of the foote, &amp;c. And on the contrary, the euill vpon a part, an euill on the whole, a weakener of the whole, whence it is that man saith, <hi>I am blinde, I am lame, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is in the matter in hand: the good and weale of a Citie, is the good and weale of the <hi>Land,</hi> and the euill of a Citie, the euill and hurt of a <hi>Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When as a part, as a Citie (as <hi>London</hi>) is ill affected, though it bee but a part, it may bee said of the <hi>Land:</hi> because the members of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:176897:49"/>this Citie are parts of the whole <hi>Land,</hi> and are by neere relations and bonds allyed to the whole <hi>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Citie is, in many respects as <hi>Hierusalem</hi> was, <hi>once thither come vp all the Tribes, there is the place and seat of Iustice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is as a Storehouse to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for many necessary commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the refuge of the Country in extremities, in euils, of fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and all manner of losses, the helpe which <hi>London</hi> affordeth, is (perhaps) better then all the rest in the Land; and therefore it cannot be but the euill of this Citie, <hi>London</hi> is the euill of the whole <hi>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Reason will farther cleare this: the <hi>sinnes</hi> which procure this iudgement, are not the sinnes of a particular, some fewe, but ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the sinnes of the whole <hi>Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that the sinne of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, might bee a cause of the euill of a <hi>Land</hi> One <hi>Achan</hi> may trouble <hi>Israel,</hi> and for <hi>Dauids</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the people, God may smite

And thus, as there is an agreement in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature of the whole, so in the actuall euils, which flowe from the same: What <hi>Rome</hi> is to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth, <hi>a mother of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mcations;</hi> great Cities in their kinds and degrees, are vnto lesser places; and lesser places againe in their kinde and degrees, vnto greater. <hi>One infected Sheepe may marre an whole flocke:</hi> the sinnes being of the Land, what meruaile if the plague

               </p>

               <p>It may be spoken to men in great place thus sinning; to <hi>Dauid,</hi> by God; to <hi>Ahab,</hi> by <hi>Eliah:</hi> thou art he that troublest <hi>Israel:</hi> to priuate men as <hi>Achan,</hi> by Magistrate and Minister.</p>

               <p>The Lord requireth humiliation, broken hearts of vs this day, it is his meane, prescribed for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the land, what more preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling argument can we finde? what wil wound the soule of a man, if not to see himselfe a wilfull murther of his deere children and wife, of so many men, women, and children, as

               <p n="2">2 It calleth vpon all men in place diligently, to looke vnto the root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of these sinnes, causing this plague, bringing so great an euill vpon the Land.

               <p>Wicked men account those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters madde, who crie out vpon those, who feare <hi>not an oath,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily pollute the glorious <hi>name of the Lord our God:</hi> all wish mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they would haue vs indeede <hi>luke warme, kay cold;</hi> and yet iudge whither there be not a cause, when as these sinnes procure so great a slaughter vpon the land: Were wee not seruants, had wee no respect to the glory of our God, this were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding a sufficient cause.</p>
               <p>Were a watchman in some Castle or key of the land, negligent in his place, not seeing an Armie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to inuade the land, not giuing warning, suffering them to land. A seruant carelesse of his Maisters
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:176897:52"/>goods, seeing a Thiefe stealing, and yet silent, making no adoe to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the same.</p>
               <p>Did a Sheepheard looke on a Woolfe, worrying his Sheepe with silence, and neither crie, nor runne vnto their helpe.</p>
               <p>Would not the world condemne that woman, seruant, and Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard? is not all that euill iustly to be imputed vnto them, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them?</p>
               <p>Euery Minister is a <hi>workman:</hi> a <hi>seruant</hi> in speciall place, and seruice of the Lord, a <hi>Sheep heard.</hi> If he see a man in his charge liue in any of the said sinnes without repentance, and be silent, hee suffereth an Armie of iudgements to inuade that man, I, that place, euen the land, hee suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euils, as Woolfes, to deuoure the Lords Sheepe: he is as that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant spoken of: all those euils must be imputed to him, and the Lord will require them of him. This fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudgement of God, the plague on our land must needes be imputed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:176897:52"/>at least in part vnto the faulty Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of many that haue that office in our Land.</p>
               <p>What was once said, is still to such Ministers and people: <hi>Be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and amend: where vision faileth</hi> by the default of a people, is not, is supprest, is disheartned, or discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged: their sinnes liue and thriue, and the people perish eternally in their soules, temporally in their health and prosperity of their body, a gap is open to all Gods curses, to this iudgement on that Land, the plague: that people die, they die in their sinnes: their blood, and the blood of the land, shall bee required at their hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where vision faileth,</hi> by the default of the Minister, sinnes grow, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment houer ouer that place, as so many blacke cloudes, <hi>that people pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> in soule and body, they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to the plague, and so is the Land: <hi>they shall die in their sinnes, their bloud shall bee required at that Ministers hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:176897:53"/>
               <p>As it calleth on Ministers, so vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Magistrates in their places, to make lawes against such sinnes, and to execute them vpon such sinners, they being the cause of the plague, an euill of the whole Land. What greater argument vnto a good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot, next vnto the glory of God, and saluation of soules, which yet are conioyned, then the good of the Land?</p>
               <p>Thou canst not bee a good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot, that art remisse in this duty, that doest conniue at such sinnes: thou doest withall conniue at the slaughter, that is now caused at home, and abroad, in all the Land. Thinke of the minaced iudgement on <hi>Elie,</hi> who did conniue at his sonnes, and feare the same iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon your selues: want of zeale in you, hath kindled zeale in the Lord, and made him in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to consume the Land.</p>
               <p n="3">3 If the plague be an euill of the Land, it is a ground of <hi>sympathie,</hi> and fellow-feeling vnto the whole

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:176897:54"/>vengeance, and without great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance must expect it: how wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie soeuer wee were of it from the Lord, and though the Lord bad <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei</hi> to curse, and let loose the Country, to vent their cruelty, the Country notwithstanding was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie, we deserued it not: it was their foule sinne, and will bee for euer remembred by God and man to their shame amongst men, and if not condemnation, <hi>as they haue sowne, they shall reape of God,</hi> it is certaine they must expect reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</p>
               <p>Yea, it is vnto the whole land, a ground of taking vp the prescribed duties, vnto which the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the healing of the Land: not onely parts, persons, Parishes, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties smitten, but those that are as yet whole, which warranteth the godly care of his Maiestie, &amp;c. at this time enioyning by Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Fast vnto the whole land. In common calamities euery man must put to his helping hand: when as a

Wee haue all our share in the cause, sinne, the good and welfare of it shall be ours, and we must looke to pertake in the euill of it: One man by humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and prayer, seeking the Lord, hath preuailed much. <hi>Moyses</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone <hi>standing in the gap, hath turned away the wrath of the Lord:</hi> If the prayers of one childe of God bee so auaileable, how much more shall be the prayers of a congregation, of so many congregations as are in this land? If one mans intreatie will <hi>giue the Lord no rest,</hi> offereth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to heauen, the prayers of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shall doe more <hi>through Iesus Christ,</hi> and wee may conceiue good

               <p>Humbling of a mans selfe, is the exercise or operation of humility; humility acted: <hi>humility an especiall worke of God, by his spirit on the elect whereby they submit themselues vnto God in soule and body, the motions and actions of both.</hi>

               <p>By the terme <hi>speciall,</hi> I difference this from that which is common, and hath not the promise. By <hi>Spirit,</hi> I meane <hi>the spirit of sanctification.</hi> By <hi>Elect,</hi> I denote the subiect, whose peculiar it is to haue this humility. <hi>Submission</hi> is the specificall act of it: the obiect is <hi>God,</hi> in his attributes word or workes. By soule, I meane the minde with thoughts, motions, and conclusions thereof, and the will, it is not a thing extorted, but willingly yeelded: and by body, I meane the mouth or words, and all other required outward expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>An humble man is one emptied of high conceit and vaine confidence, in himselfe, wit, strength, &amp;c. in whom <hi>high thoughts and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> opposite to Gods rule, <hi>are cast downe</hi> by selfe deniall: one that <hi>seeth</hi> his sinnes and iudgements mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced, iminent or inflicted, iudging them folly, <hi>accusing</hi> himselfe, <hi>I haue done foolishly,</hi> confessing the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments deserued: <hi>vnto vs belongeth

What's <hi>Esaus birth right</hi> vnto him, if hee be ready <hi>to dye with hunger?</hi> What's <hi>I shmael to Hagar;</hi> in times of famine, it causeth the <hi>eye of the tender mother to be euill vnto her owne childe;</hi> there is nothing so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or profitable in the world, but for satisfaction it will part with it.</p>
               <p>It is a like in this grace, true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: it is an emptinesse of the soule, it begetteth hunger &amp; thirst, after that which will satisfie, it will make a man to pray, and to begge of God, it will make him eloquent, feruent, mighty in prayer; it will set a man a worke to seeke it with all diligence, in the vse of the means to cast off any sinne. <hi>What haue I to doe with Idols?</hi> whats all, so long as it hath not that it desireth which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:176897:67"/>satisfieth: so that wee haue the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and it, great withall other meanes; and how can it bee, but there shall follow the healing of the Land.</p>
               <p>Besides, humility is a grace which giueth GOD his ends, aymed at in the plague. <hi>Lesse principall</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vpon Gods meanes, an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled man is a fitted man to heate, and <hi>to receiue the ingrafted word of God.</hi> To heare of iudgements and mercies, it will make a man to pray (as wee haue heard) to attend vnto the Lord in his workes of mercie and iudgement. He is a docile man,
<note place="margin">Psal. 25.</note> he hath the promise, and is disposed to all instruction and information of the Lord.</p>
               <p>It causeth a man to come in, it is submission it selfe: it maketh a man tractable in doing, in suffering whatsoeuer shall bee Gods pleasure. <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe with mee what seemeth good in his owne eyes.</hi> What doth a father intend in a rod, the Magistrate by the sword, but
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:176897:68"/>comming in of a seruant, subiect, or childe, and this doth as it were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue an heart, otherwise hardned against a man, and intending de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. <hi>Jacobs</hi> submission to <hi>Esau,</hi> altred the purpose of <hi>Esau,</hi> &amp; preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with him. It caused his very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels to yearne: he was not the man he was before: our submission hath euer annexed the melting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting, and sounding (as I may say) of the bowels of the Lord.
<note place="margin">Isai. 63.16.</note> How re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued so euer GOD was to destroy <hi>Niniueh</hi> (as appeareth in the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the Prophet, <hi>Yet fortie dayes and Niniueh shall be ouerthrowne.</hi>) It is said, <hi>God repented him of the euill, Ionah</hi> 3. And after to peeuish <hi>Ionah, should not I spare Niniueh the great Cittie, wherein are sixe score thousand persons not discerning betweene the right and left hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It disposeth to saluation, I to the maine end, Gods glory, no grace more, let God reueale himselfe <hi>iust, mercifull, angry, pleased,</hi> humility iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth God, acknowledgeth him to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:176897:68"/>be whatsoeuer hee reuealeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. How can a man question then the healing of the land?</p>
               <p>And as it disposeth and qualifieth to Gods ends, so vnto all other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and their efficacie. To peace and friendship with God, when as the Lord proclaimeth warre against a proud man, <hi>that hee will resist the proud, and behold the proud a farre off:</hi> on the contrary, <hi>vnto him I will looke that is humble, a woman or man of a meeke and quiet spirit, is a thing much set by, by the Lord I dwell with the humble.</hi> I? who art thou Lord? The great Physitian for the cure of the plague. Is it possible that hee shall thus dwell, looke, &amp;c. and not manifest the same in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the land of the plague?</p>
               <p>In a word, put true humility, and you put <hi>Christ:</hi> this is a bewrayer of him, it is an effect of Christ in that heart by faith, by vertue of Christ dwelling there, pride and high imaginations fall, are cast downe, this emptinesse is caused:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:176897:69"/>rebellion is purged away, submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wrought, Christ by his Spirit worketh it, and so proportioneth the member vnto Christ, the head; where humility is before God, there is Christ the onely name and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, in whom it is bold; denying it selfe it doth approach: and how can not Christ preuaile? humility doth not merit or deserue it of GOD, it voyce is, <hi>I am not worthy, I am lesse then the least of thy mercies.</hi> What can emptinesse deserue? It qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the person: sheweth the man with whom GOD doth dwell, in whom is Christ, in whom there is euer more acceptance of GOD. <hi>In him God is well pleased;</hi> so that in all these names it must necessarily be a meanes of healing the land.</p>

At its first entrance of the land, and euer since, we haue beene called vpon: where is our answere, where hath beene our humiliation? What meruaile if the plague encreaseth, and is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierced? that it commeth from the Country to the Citie, from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the Countrey: That it is in our Suburbs, and in this manner, in the middest of our Streetes: follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all sorts, and as it were extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humiliation.

               <p>Wee now may perceiue that a truth of <hi>Dauid, Jt is better falling into the hands of God, then man.</hi> The mercies of the Lord are very great. Had an armed enemie inuaded our land so long since, wee would haue sent to haue met him. If wee had
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:176897:70"/>not before this time, it had beene ouerrunne. It is the great mercie of the Lord that wee are not consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:176897:70"/>then may we gather vnto our selues whither wee be likely to speede this day in the businesse wee are about; namely, if vpon examination, wee finde, that wee haue humbled our selues: That GOD hath promised healing, is a truth; <hi>God is a God of truth, he will forgiue, and heale;</hi> but he must bee sought with humiliation. Examine we our selues therefore by what hath bin spoken, and aske our selues the question particularly.

               <p>Doe we now know, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our owne sinnes, pleasurable, profitable sinnes; the inward roote, the branches, especially the sinnes, which according to Gods word, cause and produce the plague? are wee perswaded they bee sinnes, and our owne? Doe wee see death mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced, imminent, acted, or executed on others, with all meanes preuious, and disposing thereunto (besides
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:176897:71"/>death spirituall and eternall) parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly this messenger of death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs: the pestilence, and the houering iudgement of famine; the wages of sinne, our owne sinnes?</p>
               <p>Are wee vpon this sight emptied of high thoughts and imaginations, arising from vaine confidence in our selues, or any thing else, out of which, wee haue formerly liued in those sinnes; contemning and slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods iudgements? Doe we now iustifie the Lord, and condemne our selues? acknowledge the Lord iust and righteous, and holy, powerfull, true, angry, and a iealous God in all effects, of the pestilence amongst vs, and whats farther minaced?</p>
               <p>Doe we now accuse our selues as deseruing causes, iudge our selues worthy, and condemne our selues? Are we come with this iudgement, as a deserued rope about our necke, in our heart and mouth; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Lord (as before) if hee execute the same on vs and ours? Doe wee in that respect crie, <hi>Let

               <p>Surely thou man or woman art, that humbler of thy selfe, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is made to thee, thou mayest waight for it; and bee encouraged to perseuere in this duty, vntill the Lord vouchsafe the healing of the Land.</p>
               <p>But if on the contrary, there bee none of these particulars amongst vs this day, we are not perswaded,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:176897:72"/>the euils spoken of, or the like in vs, to be sinnes: that wee deserue not the plague, that we are as secure out of vaine confidence, as euer before, promising to our selues, and saying, peace and safety, though we walke on: Wee doe not confesse accuse, iudge our selues, and taking shame to our selues, iustifie the Lord. If our humiliation be onely outward; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from meates, and drinkes, and outward delights: in the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the head; in a fewe, light, heartlesse, fruitlesse, slauish stashes, or Amens.</p>
               <p>If wee be as proud as euer in our mindes, as high in our imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as swelling in our words and lookes, as opposite to God, and his word, and works: that our humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation hath onely outward and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent causes, the law, and command, or example of man, or violence of this present disease. (And I would there were not cause to feare that God: looking downe from heauen, beholdeth many of this stampe, in

               <p>If there be any such amongst vs, I protest against them, that person, that humiliation, it is not Gods meane, it hath not a promise, it doth not appease, but prouoke him rather: the land, thy family, thy friends, thy selfe shall be neuer the better: as thou art the same man, in regard of sinne, thou wast before so lyable to the same iudgements; thine humiliation will be but for the time, as a bowle, after thou wilt returne to thine olde byas, <hi>as a dogge to thy former vomit, as a Sowe thou wilt wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in thy former mire:</hi> Thou wilt be as notorious a swearer, Sabboth breaker, adulterer, &amp;c. as euer thou wast before, I worse, <hi>for euill men and deceiuers wax worse and worse:</hi> Know that thou canst not promise to thy selfe, or hope that thou shalt escape this plague; thou art a man marked with the tokens: the plague sore, sinne, vnrepented of, is in thy bosome. Remember thou hast not
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:176897:73"/>to doe with man, Magistrate, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, but God and his dreadfull mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger; and if thou escape this time (as many doe which walke abroad with <hi>those tokens</hi>) thy sinne remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and punishment, and there is appointed by God a day of recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: the forbearing of the Lord abused, will but make thee ripe or <hi>fat against that day of slaughter.</hi>

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>3</label> let it bee a ground of <hi>exhortation,</hi> to answer Gods call, to vse his meanes: what wee professe, let vs doe as in Gods presence, in Gods manner, and that wee may know it, reade, heare, meditate, pray.</p>
               <p>Get that grape, exercise it, grow in it: for all these haue an eye <hi>to the Father of lights, from whence euery good gift commeth,</hi> this humiliation.</p>
               <p>All the arguments against pride, are in array to moue thee. 1. The Lord is an enemie to a proud man, <hi>hee resisteth the proud man,</hi> which is, euery one that humbleth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. 2. <hi>Pride forerunneth a fall, he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:176897:73"/>that exalteth himselfe, shall be brought low.</hi> 3, As is the fruit and brat <hi>of a fleshly minde.</hi> 4. It is a cause of all sinnes: it maketh a man vnfit to doe or receiue good of God or man: it disordereth a man in prosperity, in aduersity: it robbeth GOD of the honour of all his attributes. It ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth man (once like God) to resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the diuell, <hi>the King of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of pride.</hi> It bereaueth and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth man of all blessings, this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from the plague, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a man to all curses, the arrest of the plague: that I say no more.</p>
               <p>All the arguments commending humility, are to bee forced against our selues. Humility is a grace of graces, the luster of all graces: euery grace is in it selfe amiable, but if it be found ouer-laid with this grace in an humble man, it is <hi>as Apples of gold in pictures of siluer,</hi> as a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond in gold. Though it seemeth a cipher, nought yet being added vnto one, it maketh it (as a cipher ten, to ten an hundred. It is a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:176897:74"/>of <hi>a blessed man:</hi> it disposeth to all the promises of God: it hath this soueraigne promise of remedie, and curing the land of the plague, it is the approued medicine of that great Physitian, our eternall God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Consider thirdly, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test man in the world, hath sufficient cause to humble himselfe, at all times, specially, now in this time of the plague. Whence are we? our father <hi>Adam,</hi> and mother <hi>Eue,</hi> our <hi>father an Amerite, our mother an Hittite.</hi> There is enough in this one particular, were it resolued: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue <hi>Adam</hi> our principle is <hi>dust: Wee are but dust and ashes, as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham: our foundation is in the dust, wee dwell in houses of clay as Iob, dust wee are, into dust shall we returne againe:</hi> resolue that principle, &amp; thy terme is nothing.</p>
               <p>Consider thy comming into this world: <hi>Naked came I out of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, and naked shall I returne againe. Wee brought nothing into this present world, and it is certaine, wee
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:176897:74"/>shall carrie nothing out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All worldly matters which puffe vp are vanity, <hi>riches haue wings, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is fading, strength fraile, honour shall lye in the dust, the most desirable things in a man as a moath.</hi> Mans life a <hi>vapour, a bubble, a shadow, a flower, grasse, all flesh is grasse, the grasse withereth, the flower fadeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: like vnto vanity, altogether va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, lighter then vanitie.</hi> Heere are causes enough of humility.</p>
               <p>There are more yet, if wee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our estate by sinne. It is true: we were holy and happy creatures, <hi>little lower then the Angels,</hi> we haue lost that <hi>state; we are free from righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and the seruants of sinne: conceiued in iniquity, borne in sinne; euery imagination of the thoughts of mans heart, is euill only and continually.</hi> Thus doe we liue and dye, without Gods rich mercie: hence are wee odious to God, <hi>Alians, enemies,</hi> open to death, temporall death, all curses written, and those <hi>that are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;</hi> lyable more and more to spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:176897:75"/>death, I vnto eternall death, <hi>blacknesse of darknesse for euer:</hi> if these are not, what may be motiues vnto vs of humility?</p>
               <p>Consider this sin is against God, we haue to deale with him: <hi>An ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God of purer eyes, then to behold ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie: a righteous God,</hi> one that will giue vnto euery man <hi>whats his owne:</hi> we may see it in the suffering of our suerty; <hi>God spared not his owne Son, the sword must awake &amp; smite the mā, that is his fellow: wrath is reuealed frō heauen, against all vngodlinesse: our suerty must tread the wine-presse of his Fathers wrath.</hi> The iudgements of God preach Gods iustice, this iudgement, the plague, wherewith he hath swept away thousands <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene thousand once, foure and twentie thousand</hi> another time, 70000. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. We see it amongst our selues, and there is no running from his presence.</p>
               <p>Yea, as if our owne sinnes were not enough, we haue the sinnes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the sinnes of <hi>fathers,</hi> and the

I may runne through all rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and wee haue to doe with <hi>a iealus God, visiting the iniquity of the Fathers, vpon their children, to the third and fourth generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Adde yet: all this haue wee done, notwithstanding Gods manifold mercies: <hi>creation, preseruation, liuing, mouing, being,</hi> being not beasts, Toades, wormes, but reasonable men: notwithstanding all commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of our land, a land as <hi>Canaan, flowing with milke and honey:</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the time, not vnder the olde Testament but the new: not in times of Heathenisme, or darknesse, of Popish <hi>Egyptian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> but in times of the cleare sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine of the Gospell; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all positiue good things, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerances former, from fearefull euils.</p>
               <p>All these are causes and motiues of getting, and vse of humiliation in this day: which I therefore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that by them wee may enforce
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:176897:76"/>our selues vnto that duty.</p>
               <p>It calleth vpon all, especially Gods people, the meek of the earth: exercise humility, still seeke meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as the Prophet speaketh.</p>
               <p>Though wee haue humbled our selues, the Lord requireth of vs still, that we doe it more and more, and in so doing, promiseth, <hi>hiding in the day of the wrath of the Lord, Zeph.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p>Consider, that euen <hi>all our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is as a polluted cloath; he that is holy, must bee so yet:</hi> Hee that is humble, hath cause of humiliation; for want of humiliation, for weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in humiliation: we <hi>know God,</hi> and our selues, <hi>but in part,</hi> and such is our humiliation.</p>
               <p>Consider, that the pestilence is now amongst those that are his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And to encourage thee, know, that as humiliation hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of healing the Land; so thou that art indeede a confederate, hast a promise of humility; a promise of it power, it vse, it groath: <hi>He that

               <p>It is a truth sometimes, not euer. Many that call on the name of the Lord, are thus saued. If not, it is Gods meanes, and it shall further their account.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:176897:86"/>answer at the first call, that hee may exercise grace, faith, hope, patience: <hi>Hee that beleeueth maketh not haeste; if we hope, we abide with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, saith the Apostle:</hi> and so for the triall of grace: a counterfeit may for a fit <hi>howle vpon his bed,</hi> crie <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> he will not hold out: <hi>he will not pray alwayes,</hi> the Lord will giue vs a sight of sinne, and sensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his displeasure, that wee may <hi>search and trie our wayes, and turne vnto the Lord.</hi> The benefit begged, must bee valued when it commeth: The Lord delighteth in the prayers of his Saints, as a father in the talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a childe. A childe is so set on his play, that he is hardly drawne to talke; therefore the father holdeth the Apple in his hand; had the child the Apple, farewell father: and right thus is it with vs and God. It may be wee are not fitted for that blessing: it may be the Lord intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a greater: for all these reasons he deferring answer, will haue vs to holde out in prayer. <hi>The Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:176897:86"/>saith, that Christ put forth a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the scope of which,</hi> was, <hi>that wee should pray, and not be weary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Last of all, when as a man doth pray, hee must vse all other meanes. <hi>Paul in a storme prayed,</hi> had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of safety, and yet all must <hi>abide in the ship.</hi> When the Lord will saue <hi>Lot,</hi> hee must serue his prouidence, <hi>and goe out of Sodome. Iacob wrastled with God, and preuailed,</hi> receiued a promise, to <hi>preuaile with man.</hi> Hee did so, and yet went and met <hi>Esau, brought him a present, and fell before him seauen times. Hezekiah prayeth,</hi> is heard, and yet <hi>vseth a bunch of Figges.</hi> Wee must not now looke, that the Lord prescribe the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Physicke, or outward preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: That case was extraordinarie: his ordinarie meane is <hi>a learned and godly Physitian,</hi> auoyd vnwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble occasions of danger, as compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie with such as are infected; vse all other meanes, euen flight it selfe, (with its cautions) otherwise we do but as he that <hi>crieth Lord,</hi> and lyeth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:176897:87"/>still in the ditch: He that hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the end, deliuery, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth meanes, prayer, and all other; our prayer, without vse of other meanes, is but a tempting of God, a prouocation of God.</p>
               <p>We now see what must be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, what taken vp. The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ingredients, I haue spent time in gathering them, and naming them, they are all substantiall, I could not leaue as much as one out: now let vs put this to vse.</p>
               <p>We are this day by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demen of God and man, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God: One taske enioyned vs by both, is prayer: by prayer we are to <hi>entreate the face of the Lord,</hi> to take away from vs his heauie hand in the plague, his imminent hand of famine; his gracious protection of our Nauie and Armies, by sea and land, to remoue our sinnes which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can hinder.</p>
               <p>It would comfort our soules to bee perswaded, wee shall preuaile with God: it would trouble vs not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:176897:87"/>a little, that hee should still frowne vpon vs, and reiect our prayers. <hi>With Caine it would cast our counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances downe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If wee will bee freed from the trouble of the one, and enioy the comforts of the other, we must pray in this manner. Examine wee our selues therefore of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>Haue we departed from our sins? omissions, commissions, all sinnes, the sinnes especially which cause the plague. Is there a cessation in mouth, in life, I, in our hearts from the same? is it our desire and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and haue wee attaining that, set our selues to call vpon God this day?</p>
               <p>Are we come, and doe wee vse a liuely faith, hope, charity, holinesse, righteousnesse, innocencie, and the rest of the named graces: are our prayers feruent, as those that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirst for the fauour of God? Doe wee lift vp hearts as well as hands to GOD, building vpon his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:176897:88"/>promises, with resignation to his will, and all in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ? And is there a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in thee to perseuere in prayer, and the vse of all other holy and wholsome meanes. Surely the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are made to vs, so many of vs may waight on the Lord comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, for a gracious answer. Wee haue sowne for it, <hi>and in due time we shall reape, if we faint not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if it bee otherwise with vs, that as yet wee still liue in our olde sinnes; the particulars often spoken of, which haue called out the plague, being the old men &amp; womē we were before. There being no restraint of those courses, or onely that which is outward, for this day and time of humiliation, our hearts and minds being as foule as euer before. If it bee so that none of those graces, or not all; (indeede where they be not all, there bee none) which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngredients in this duty of prayer, or the manner. (And good Lord, how many such men call vpon
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:176897:88"/>God this day? no naturall man can doe it. <hi>All the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart are euill, onely, and continually:</hi> they are men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith <hi>and hope, none of them that doe good, no not one;</hi> they are <hi>naturall men, without the spirit,</hi> and so the fruits or graces of the same. They cannot bee feruent, holy fire is not kindled within them, how can it flame? <hi>Hipocrites cannot pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</hi> How much lesse the man that is vnder Gods curse, in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and hardnesse of heart, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in sinne, <hi>accustomed to doe euill,</hi> on whom the sentence is past, for long vnfruitfulnesse vnder the Gospell, <hi>neuer growe fruit vpon thee more:</hi> and there be many thousands of these knowne vnto GOD in our congregations.)</p>
               <p>If it bee thus with any of vs this day, calling vpon the name of the Lord: Bee it knowne vnto that soule; the Lord maketh thee no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of hearing: thy prayer is not the Lords iniunction, it hath not his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:176897:89"/>ingredients: thou canst not expect a blessing on thy prayers, in regard of person, family, Parish, Citie, our Nauie or Land: thou prouokest God rather, and callest for a curse: thy prayer is but sinne; depart from iniquity; amend thy wayes: then come and pray, and expect a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: it is not euery prayer that is preuailing, or required that which hath the fore-named ingredients, thats it which hath the promise of Gods hearing, and healing our Land.</p>
               <p>Last of all, if prayer bee the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of GOD, let it moue vs all to pray.
<note place="margin">Lam. 3.56</note>
                  <hi>Let euery creature</hi> of this land, <hi>hauing this breath, breath it out</hi> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer vnto the Lord. Such as haue not the spirit of prayer, cease not vntill you finde your vnction, and the holy spirit of prayer bee powred out vpon you. Such as haue it, labour for it more and more, vse it in publique, in priuate; vse it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, in all things, in all meanes, let them bee sanctified by prayer:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:176897:89"/>pray, and that in this manner.</p>
               <p>Consider it is whats commanded by God, thou that doest it not, art but a rebell. It proclaimeth thee an arch Athiest in these times: their Character is, <hi>they call not vpon God, Psalm.</hi> 14. It sheweth (whatsoeuer thou doest pretend) thou hast nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faith, nor hope, nor loue, nor feare of God at all: Faith will flame in prayer, <hi>will speake:</hi> hope will vse meanes; loue will not bee hindred, fellowship, and talke; the feare of God teacheth this wisedome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> out of all these, rather then hee will omit prayer, will loose his life: it openeth a man to all Gods iudgements; to Gods indignation, the <hi>Butt</hi> of God in this respect, is the <hi>heathen,</hi> and <hi>families that call not vpon Gods name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider Prayer is an holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with God: that which bringeth vs into Gods presence more specially, our heauen vpon earth; <hi>Jn thy presence is fulnesse of ioy:</hi> Hell is especially, <hi>a banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:176897:90"/>from Gods presence.</hi> It is a Key which vnlocketh all Gods trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, the treasures that are in Christ; the treasures that are in God. <hi>Whatsoeuer ye aske the Father in my name he will giue it.</hi> An hooke which pulleth downe from heauen <hi>euery good and perfect gift.</hi> It it as <hi>Incense,</hi> when <hi>Araon</hi> ran and put on Incense, the plague ceased: It is sacrifice, when <hi>Dauid</hi> offred sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, the plague likewise ceased. It is as <hi>dropping of an honey combe, Caent.</hi> 4.11. As pleasing vnto the Lord as honey to the mouth of man. As the Lord (once to <hi>Eliah</hi> of <hi>Ahab) seest thou how Ahab humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:</hi> So the Lord now, much more of euery one of his poore humbled seruants, as the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Paul, to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias,</hi> the Lord is now ready to say, <hi>Behold he prayeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider Prayer is in the power of euery child of God, it was in the power of man; if he hath lost it, he may thanke, or rather blame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: in the moment of your Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:176897:90"/>or incision vnto Christ by Faith, <hi>God powred out on you the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of supplication and prayer, ye recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the spirit of Adoption, whereby you cry, Abba, Father.</hi> If the Lord had required a greater matter (as <hi>Naamans</hi> seruants to <hi>Naaman</hi> of the Prophet) should wee not haue done it? how much more when as it is, but aske and haue?</p>
               <p>Consider, Prayer is a meane to all meanes, grace; its power, its vse, its growth (how much more temporall meanes) <hi>Aske and your ioy shall be full.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider, Prayer is a meanes a man may vse at any time, and in any place: there are times and places, we cannot haue other meanes. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, Phisicke, neighbour, friend, no friend to go vnto the Physition, or Phisition to come: As it is a salue for all sores, so it is euer in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: In euery day of trouble, hee may vse it in the day, I, and at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when man cannot goe to man, hee may goe to God, when a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:176897:91"/>man cannot speake to man, hee may speak to God: when a man cannot speak with his mouth, he may speak in his heart, or by groanes and sighes in prayer.</p>
               <p>Consider, if a man haue no other meanes, yet this is sufficient. <hi>Bee carefull for nothing, saith the Apostle, Phil.</hi> 4.6. that is, with a distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, distrusting, or diuiding care; <hi>But in euery thing, with supplication and prayer, and giuing of thankes, let your requests bee made knowne vnto God.</hi> Good Lord what straights are wee in at this time? how many things trouble vs? wiues, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and seruans, kindred, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, friends, cares of the Citie, cares of the whole Land, wee are at our wits ende, and what shall wee doe? <hi>Be carefull for nothing.</hi> If thou canst but <hi>pray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider, it is <hi>not a vaine thing to call vpon the Lord,</hi> (as those in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Wee are this day againe in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, seeking Gods face: seeking is his ordinance; it hath a promise: and we may expect to finde him, if we doe it in his manner: and that we may know the successe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether we haue, or now doe seeke the Lord in this manner or no.</p>
               <p>Haue wee laboured to finde the

               <p>As many as can answer I, may conclude, they seeke; they haue the promise, and may expect to finde the Lord: that the Lord will bee with our Nauie, that hee will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue our sinnes, and heale our Land: though wee haue not the <hi>measure of the Sanctuarie,</hi> whats required, so <hi>our hearts are set to seeke the Lord; our good Lord will be mercifull, let pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haue it perfect worke,</hi> goe on.</p>

               <p>Sure I am, you would be all glad to heare of the Lords hand in the pestilence stayed: thou wouldest not haue it in the Land or Citie, not in thy Parish, much lesse in thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or on thy person, thou wouldest doe what in thee lyeth to procure that freedome: the meanes of the Lord is seeking, and that in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, casting away thy sinnes, thou must amend: as thou doest expect that blessing, deliuerance, and to be freed of that euill, seeke: put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the euill of thy doings, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thy life; the sentence of the Lord otherwise is peremptory, <hi>thou shalt seeke him diligently, and hee will not be found.</hi>

               <p>Of those that doe seeke, the most doe it in hypocrisie: they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and constrained by somewhat outward, the law of man, example, Gods iudgement, then they crie as <hi>Pharaoh, send for Moyses, and Aron and pray</hi> the Lord that hee will take away this plague; I will let <hi>Israel</hi> goe.

Consider his call; his expectation and looking downe from heauen, to see if we answer, his seeking, as a <hi>good Sheepheard</hi> in his ordinances (they not working) in and by his iudgements. Let the fearefull destruction wrought, and desolation threatned, in Citties,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:176897:104"/>Streetes, Parishes, and houses, moue vs. Let the consideration of our proposition, that seeking is a meanes, preuaile with vs. Let vs consider the example of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters that are faithfull, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, seeking Saints, with the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of this publique Fast, of this day of life, it may be wee may neuer haue the like againe. How many thousands are weekely cut off from <hi>the land of the liuing,</hi> resting from their labours, cannot seeke: theres none of this worke in the graue.

It is not good prouoking the Lord, neither will it be profitable for vs. Consider if wee seeke him in his manner, <hi>wee shall finde him:</hi> the swifter we are to seeke him, the slower will hee be in iudgement to find vs. When <hi>Aaron</hi> ranne at the commaund of <hi>Moyses,</hi>

Were wee swift to seeke the Lord, he would be flow to wrath, and his bowels would yearne. The Lord calleth on vs in his word, in his worke, by authority, and hath giuen some of vs purposes and bent of heart, a power in a measure, and it deede, and it is encreased, since wee haue set our hearts to seeke him: in these things wee haue <hi>beene found of him, when we sought him not:</hi> Surely the desire, I, all these are from the Lord: had hee a purpose vtterly to destroy vs, he would neuer haue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered things in this manner; <hi>his manner is, to prepare our heart, and so
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:176897:105"/>to cause his eare to heare:</hi> as many of vs as finde it, let it encourage vs to seeke him still, and bee vnto vs a pledge, that a time shall come we shall surely finde his face, which is our next Proposition.</p>

               <p n="2">2 If seeking Gods fauour bee a meanes of healing the Land of the plague, then when as the Lord shall send the pestilence vpon a Land, there the face and fauour of GOD may be said to be valed and hid.

The <hi>ioy</hi> that ariseth from Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, is more then theirs, <hi>whose corne and wine, and oyle encreaseth:</hi> the losse of Gods fauor a greater cause of griefe, then the losse of corne, or wine, and oyle: <hi>in Gods fauour is life,</hi> without it death; the fauour of <hi>God is better then life it selfe,</hi> the losse of Gods fauour <hi>more bitter then death.</hi> A great punishment it is for a childe to bee put out of the fauour
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:176897:109"/>and presence of his Father, to haue a charge to see his face no more; or not to see his face, a gracelesse child, a childe that hath but affection of nature will thinke it so. When as <hi>Absolom</hi> (hauing slaine his brother <hi>Amnon</hi>) fled to <hi>Geshur,</hi> and had bin there three yeares; as a man bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from the face of his father, it could not bee but a great affliction.

                  <hi>Now therefore let mee see the Kings face, and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.</hi> He compareth it with banishment, and chuseth a triall, I, death it selfe rather: Is it such a misery to loose the face of a man, and is it not greater to loose the face of God? Is it so much to be without the fauour of an earthly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and is not more to be without the fauourable countenance of our heauenly Father? will a childe, a naturall childe, an vnnaturall rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious childe as was <hi>Absolom,</hi> grieue so much for the lesser, and shall not wee much more for the greater? What a cause haue wee then of this Cittie, of this Land, of griefe? how may wee crie out and complaine as the godly woman: <hi>Our glorie is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, our glory is departed.</hi> Who can but trauell with paine, as that wife of <hi>Phinies.</hi>

                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:176897:110"/>thats her sorrow: and whats the plague and its desolation, that it taketh away husband or wife, or childe, or friend, that we enioy all these, and what euer else, so long as Gods face is gone. We may call all these <hi>Ieabod,</hi> and crie, our glory is departed: Wee must preferre this as our greatest griefe. O that wee know, and were sufficiently sensible of this losse, what an hatred would it breede in vs of sinne, all sinnes, the sinnes which haue procured this plague? It would make a man ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre Sabboth-breaking, swearing, cursing, drunkennesse, idolatry, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It would appeare, who are the bane and burthen of the Land, the rotten and accursed members of a Cittie. The light and heate of fire in Winter wee cannot be without: they were enemies to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, that did hinder the same: much more if a man could hide from a Land, the rayes and beames of the Sunne: what are you who
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:176897:111"/>withdraw the face, and shine of the countenance of God; when as you cause the plague? you cause the cause of the plague: the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods face, you hinder the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and cure of the plague, Gods fauour and face: which is to bee sought for.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Let it moue vs to seeke, and to seeke <hi>Gods face,</hi> and withall to take vp all other duties required of God, as ingredients in the seeking of Gods face. It is not euery seeking, and so not euery seeking of Gods fauour that will finde his face. I haue shewed the former already, and yet will not bee sorrie to goe ouer the same againe, seeing I finde them particularly applied by <hi>Gods spirit,</hi> to the duty in hand, seeking Gods face.</p>
               <p>Generally the man that seeketh Gods face, must put away sinnes, specially such as cause the plague. One iudgement threatned for sin, is the hiding of Gods face.

               <p n="1">1 An <hi>Action,</hi> in the word <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 The obiect, <hi>Wayes,</hi> set foorth by their qualities, <hi>wicked wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wayes in this place is a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall</hi> speech, it doth denote a mans life so and so ledd, or a state of life; a <hi>power</hi> that a man hath and it <hi>exercise</hi> or vse in a course. It is taken in a good sense, and so it doth denote grace and its exercise, thus we reade of the <hi>way of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and pathes of righteousnesse, and walking in the feare of God, in the lawe of God, in newnesse of life.</hi> In an euill sense for sinne and its exercise, which is called <hi>the way of the wicked,</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:176897:115"/>which is any wicked course or trade of life, contrary to the former, <hi>the olde way and the good way,</hi> and of the latter, the Lord speaketh in this place, as appeareth by the adiunct, wicked: from these a man must turne. By turning the Lord mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, a leauing off that course, and taking vp an other, a contrary trade of life.</p>
               <p>As when a man is out of his way, if euer hee looketh to come to his iourneyes ende hee must returne to the right way: So is it in this case. Sinne is auersion from the Lord, a going from him, a turning inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to somewhat else: Thus is man borne, his backe is vpon the Lord, he is thus in habit or disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of soule and body, according to this are all his motions; inward, outward, with his backe still vpon the Lord, he is in progresse by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall motion, vntill he commeth to terme death, Destruction.</p>
               <p>Now when as the Lord requireth turning, it is to set his backe vpon
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:176897:116"/>sinne, and his face towards God: and therefore the phrase vsed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is, <hi>returne,</hi> which infouldeth conformitie to the Lawe of GOD in soule and body, in the habite and exercise of grace.</p>
               <p>In a word, the Lord in this place calleth for <hi>Repentance;</hi> in doing which, the manner of the Lord, is sometimes to mention one terme, as in this place, <hi>Turne from their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill wayes.</hi> Sometimes hee calleth for it by the other terme, Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Turne,</hi> or <hi>returne vnto me.</hi> Sometimes the Lord calleth for it, mentioning one particular sinne, infolding all the rest. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he mentioneth one grace, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding all the rest: The word vsed in the new Testament signifieth, a change of the minde: and yet thats not the largenesse of its significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it infoldeth the former part tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from sinne: enfoldeth the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, the change of the Will, Memory, Conscience, Affections, with the motions, and the outward
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:176897:116"/>man, and for this cause it is transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (a part put for the whole) <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you liues.</hi> Sometimes againe, the Scripture mentioneth both termes, and coupleth them,
<note place="margin">Ier. 35.15.</note> as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne now euery man from his euill way, and amend your doings.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 1.16. &amp;c.</note>
                  <hi>Cease from euill, learne to doe well.</hi> When as the Lord therefore calleth heere for turning from euill wayes, hee doth imply, turning to the right way also, and so all positiue graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dispositions or qualities, and their exercise, which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This dutie (if you obserue) hee enioyneth all the people called by his name, such as are so onely by profession, and such as are so indeed already truely turned: Euery one must turne from sinnes, euen those that are turned, more and more; euery one must turne vnto God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen those that are turned, more and more; and that in regard of the power of sinne, its habit and vse, and power of grace, its habit and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:176897:117"/>vse. And lastly, the terme is layd downe indefinitly, which is all one with an vniuersall turning from all euill wayes, and turning to GOD according to all his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And thus will I stand on, and handle all the particulars in their order distinctly. And first obserue:

               <p>It hindreth our prayers, it setteth vpon faith and hope, raiseth doubts, dismayeth, and discourageth the soule.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> those that are turned from sinne, that which is truely and properly sinne. It were vaine either by word or worke to call vpon man to turne from that which is not; to mortifie and kill it, to put it off: that which is not can haue none of these affections: it were to bid a man to fight with his shaddow; afflictions were vain, that which is not cannot bee purged by them. If any confesse actuall sinnes in wordes or deedes, I demaund, whence these come, and whether, if it were not in the heart, it could be in the mouth, or life? <hi>Out of the aboundance and treasure that is in the heart, the mouth speaketh.</hi> I demand, whether it were not an vniust thing to smite them with sicknesse, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:176897:134"/>and sleepe, being the fruits of sinne? Were there no experience of Gods Saints vpon earth; that one Text, <hi>Colloss.</hi> 3.5. where the Apostle calleth on them to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their members, fornication, and vncleannesse, &amp;c. (vnlesse they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie them Saints, or their members sinnes) is enough to conuince blind Papists, who teach that after Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme there is no thing remaining, which is properly, and formally sinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It sheweth a <hi>reason</hi> of Gods proceeding by the pestilence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as are truely his owne,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>2</label> and for <hi>exhortation</hi> vnto them, that they will answer Gods call, and vse his meanes. The reason of it, is some sinne vnmortified and vntamed, in regard of some degrees, and the deedes thereof, not turned from. You may say they are Saints, It is a truth of euery childe of God, and yet euen they sinne, and for that cause are sicke, and weake, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe. Which is to be laid downe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:176897:134"/>as a certaine conclusion for the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of God, and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our selues.</p>
               <p>For the second, exhortation; this being Gods prescript, hearken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and obey it. I speake vnto you that are within, that are indeed cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of GOD: Your eyes must not be onely on the sinns of others, and your mouthes open on them, but on your selues; your hearts, your thoughts, your words, your owne workes. I am sure you looke in an especiall manner to bee preserued, that the Lord acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you, that the Lord would put a difference between you that serue him and those that serue him not: you suppose that if you be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, roote, the sore at lest, in the mouthes of prophane ones, mockers, haters of religion, who will be readier to gather, as poyson, that sinne, such sinnes as haue beene named, are not the causes of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, and so not sinnes: seeing euen you that protest against them,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:176897:135"/>are notwithstanding taken away, and you doe well. <hi>I haue desired that they, euen mine enemies, Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, triumph not ouer mee, saith Dauid.</hi> You would haue Gods <hi>marke</hi> and token of good vpon you: when as the messenger of God passeth our steerts, that it passe ouer you; that if any men maligne you, they may see it and bee ashamed. You professe your selues an obedient and tractable people, willing to know, and to doe GODS will, and are so if you bee Gods people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede: shew it in harkening to Gods call, and in the vse of his meanes. What those sinnes are, your selues can best tell: I could be contented not to publish them in <hi>Gath,</hi> but the <hi>Lord willeth that wee cry aloud, that we tell Iudah of her sinnes.</hi> Hee hath somewhat against the best of vs, amongst vs their may be some <hi>Achan,</hi> some accursed thing, from whence it is that the Lord doth not heare vs, but swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth euen of vs away.</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:176897:135"/>
               <p>Is their not in you some preua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent corruption or lust; which most of all swayeth; suppose couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, pride, enuie, anger, vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or the like; and their deedes varnished and glossed with many faire colours, and walles of defence, as Figgleaues, and are you not iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open to taxation for them? Are there not amongst you all, those, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, wrath, malice, enuie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitablenesse, and their fruits: because of difference in iudgement, and that oftentimes in indifferent things, doth not your face or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance shew it? Besides words and deeds, one scarce acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other a brother, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise of the same houshold, faith and workes? I wish this taken into consideration: Is there not amongst you, backebiting, slandering, false witnesse-bearing, and deceiuing, and the degrees of the spirit, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, euill thoughts and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and that against dignities?</p>
               <p>Are there no corruptions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:176897:136"/>your compasse conniued at, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purged in your trades and callings, children, families? Neglect or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle respect to familier duties, in Husband, Wife, Father, Child, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Seruant, according to relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? (Though particularly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and punctually set down) to the peace of the Familie, flowrishing of the Common-wealth, and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religion? Is there not much neglect of publique worshipe, in Gods Ordinances, and priuate prayer?

               <p>And let not any man rise vp, and conclude, I wrong Gods children, the things are neither so nor so; and I withall discard them from being Gods Children. <hi>Let God bee true, and all men lyars.</hi> I could bee more particular; <hi>Is is not before the Lord?</hi>

It would kindle anger, it would burne, it will make one to speake and strike, to kill and slay, to turne and runne too from it, if that would serue: All of them in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the weale of soule and body, may cause vs to doe so, a great deale more.</p>
               <p>Consider thy promises &amp; vowes, the first vow thou diddest make in baptisme, when as thou didst giue <hi>vp thy name vnto God:</hi> namely, thy forsaking the deuill, and all his workes, thy maintainance of warre against sinne, as <hi>Israel</hi> was bound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Amaleck from generation to generation.</hi> Consider thine owne

               <p>Thus in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the Lord hauing expressed a wicked Father by his sinnes, speaking of the sonne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted the punishment of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sinne, describeth him by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary actions, denying and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from his fathers sinnes known. <hi>A seer of all his sinnes,</hi> vers. 14. <hi>One that hath not eaten vpon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, one that hath not lifted vp his eyes to the Idols of the house of Jsrael, that hath not defiled his neighbours wife, that hath not oppressed any, nor holden the pledge, neither spoyled by violonce &amp;c. that hath not receiued vpon Vsurie, &amp;c.</hi> and then on the other side, <hi>hath walked in my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> Of such a Sonne he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, <hi>He shall not dye for the iniquitie of the Father he shall surely liue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is worthy our considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:176897:149"/>to take notice how Gods people haue expressed their contrariety. Of <hi>Lot liuing in Sodome,</hi> it is said, <hi>hee saw, and heard, and was vexed in his righteous soule from day to day, for their vnlawfull deedes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.8.</note> In the ninth of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> those that are exempted from that iudgement, are said to bee such, <hi>as crie, and mourne for all the abominations done in the Cittie.

               <p>Adde hereunto the complaints of Gods people vnto God: So <hi>Eliah, the children of Israel haue forsaken thy couenant, throwne downe thine Altars,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:176897:150"/>and slain thy Prophets with the sword,</hi> 1, <hi>Reg</hi> 19.10.</p>
               <p>Of this kinde are the priuate whisperings of Gods people, in the Church of the Iewes, of matters which sometimes may not safely be spoken, or borne. Then <hi>they that feared the Lord, spake often one vnto another, Mal.</hi> 3.16.</p>

               <p>Hither vnto may we referre, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting by aduice and counsell, by dislike, by reproofe, according to a mans place. <hi>Iob suffered his seruant to contend with him.</hi> A Magistrate must by reproofe, and execution of iudgement. A Minister ought to reproue in his place, keeping his bounds, and so both are cleare: if they doe not, the people shall <hi>dye in their sinnes, and their blood will be

                  <hi>Vnto euery wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, saith God, what hast thou to doe to take my word, or name, in thy mouth, being a man that doest hate to be reformed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou canst not vse meanes thy selfe. I pray thee who shall vse them for thee? thou wilt send to thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:176897:158"/>or neighbour: If thou amend not (suppose they pray) what helpe can come vnto thee? No man can regularly pray while hee hath no promise, as long as thou doest not amend thy life, thou hast no promise: What shalt thou be the better if an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other pray?</p>
               <p>Besides, Gods pestilence is as a plaister: the <hi>Chirurgion</hi> putting on the one, aymeth at the cure of thy body: the Lord sending the other at the health of thy soule. The plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster may not bee taken away, vntill the sore mend, vnlesse it bee to put on another, nor may wee looke for the remoueall of the plague, vntill our liues doe amend, vnlesse it be to send another.</p>
               <p>It is true, we <hi>must pray one for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:</hi> for forgiuenesse of sinnes, and the healing of the Land: but if it be according to Gods will, it must bee first for repentance, and so for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of sinnes, and the healing of the land. Thats the course thou must take for thy selfe, if God heare
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:176897:158"/>thy prayer, thou must first amend. I, that the prayers of others, for thee, may preuaile with God for forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp;c. thou must see that thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. The plague was neuer taken away in mercy, but iustice rather, where men doe not amend.</p>
               <p>Neither may we now trust in ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words (as the most doe) of faith, and hope, the spirit, Christ &amp; Gods mercy, so long; these are lying words, as we doe not amend. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let man say, I doe repent, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue such as say one may, when as hee doth not amend. It is not the <hi>stroke</hi> vpon the <hi>breast,</hi> when thou doest sweare, and saying, I crie God mercy. It is not thy <hi>sighing,</hi> nor euery sorrow indeede, (much lesse griefe like the sicknesse of a dogge causing him to vomite) not euery shaking with feare of hell, as a man in the fit of an Ague; it is no one, nor all these, or more, I, or any thing else, that a man may in this sence safely trust vnto: they are as lying wordes, so long as a man
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:176897:159"/>doth not amend.</p>
               <p>The faith thou doest talke of seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from this, will not <hi>saue thee:</hi> true faith that saueth, is a liuely faith, <hi>a purifier of the heart.</hi> It hath all good workes: the man that is <hi>dead and buried with Christ, is risen with him also, and that by faith of the operation of God, Col.</hi> 2.</p>

The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:176897:159"/>that shall stand for true, and good before God, is amendment of life. Thou hast none of all these indeed, that hast not amēdmēt of life.

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:176897:161"/>Promise is made to returning sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; it doth hold more strongly, where there is turning more and more.

                  <hi>Seeke yee the Lord all yee meeke of the earth, which haue wrought his iudgements, seeke meekenesse, seeke righteousnesse:</hi> and then the promise followeth, <hi>It may be you shall bee hidd in the day of the Lords wrath.</hi> Wherein by the day of Gods wrath (as the plague is) the promise of God of hiding is made vnto a farther see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of meekenesse and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

<label type="milestone">

If God cause such in that case to sleep, and they shall neuer awake, such as shal not be condemned in the world to come, must bee vnderstood, of failing in degree, or measure, or some acts. The want of it being a cause of the plague, it must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued; indeauour for grace and acts more and more must be put for the healing of the plague.</p>

               <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But the scope of the Lord in this is to decipher, true Conuerts, whose propertie is to turne vnto God more and more by his meanes and working, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude others from that number who doe not so; and withall, to stirre vs vp to co-worke with him, to that

               <p n="1">1 Learne hence:
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse </seg>1</label> first, that our graces, and so conuersion vnto God who are regenerate, are not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of degrees perfect: were they perfect, we needed no precepts, nor spurre, nor rodde; this violent meanes of purging, that wee might bring forth more fruit. And hence we may argue,</p>
               <p n="1">1 I argue, That inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, (being imperfect) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the formall cause, or that by which wee stand iustified before GOD, which <hi>Romanists</hi> teach, and that there is another <hi>righteousnesse to be sought after,</hi> by which that may be done; the perfect righteousnesse of <hi>Christ</hi> imputed and giuen vnto vs, <hi>put on by faith,</hi> which Papists de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and call putatiue.</p>

               <p n="3">3 I argue, that good work can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee condigne and meritorious causes of eternall life, against Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists, especially those that teach it, without relation to Gods graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous couenant and promises in Iesus Christ, there is lesse then is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, which is <hi>sinne,</hi> whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne <hi>stipend is eternall death.</hi>

               <p>And what will become of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of supererogation, which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth doing of more.

It bereaueth a man of any portion in Gods promise, it keepeth him in danger of the curse; without a promise there can be no seeking or preauiling prayer.</p>
               <p>One vertue denied (required by God) in the said prescripts before, is as a principall ingredient in the composition of the Apothicarie. It is more, it denieth all the rest: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie righteousnesse, or holinesse, or loue, you denie faith: denie faith,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:176897:172"/>you denie all other graces. Sauing graces, are all inseperably linked and chained together. They make the new creature perfect in regard of parts, where any part, or grace is wanting, there is a monster, partly belonging to heauen, partly to hell, euidences are vncontrouleably true of either. Neither can any man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept against one grace, it necessity may easily be shewed. In all which respects, wee see it must bee a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from all sinnes, and a turning vnto God, according to all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>

The fault is not in the Physitian, if hee prescribe that vnto thee which thou canst not get, when as nothing else will doe it. The fault in this case is in thy selfe: Hee made thee perfectly holy and happy, able to doe all, and may require all, thou hast lost that ability; the fault is in thy selfe, and thou must lay thine hand vpon thine owne mouth.</p>
               <p>But it is otherwise, this may bee and is performed (God assisting) by his Saints.</p>
               <p>Theres a double doing of all, or perfection; one in regard of parts, the other in regard of degrees: Of parts; When as a man shall turne from euery euill, and doe euery good: that is, when as the power of euery sinne is broken, and a congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous disposition in euery faculty of soule, and part of body; so that though sinne bee in euery part, it is not a Monarke, it is not allowed and approued, and wholy obaved, but in euery part oppugned, lusted
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:176897:173"/>against: and so when as there is euery grace present in the soule, it power and proportioned motions, so that though there be weakenesse, and wants in degrees, yet there is euery grace and it motion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto it measure.</p>
               <p>Perfection of degrees is, when as a man faileth not in any degree, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from sinne in euery degree, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of it inward disposition or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and vse or act; turneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in euery degree of the habit and acts.</p>
               <p>When as the Lord calleth in this place for this turning, though hee require according to the law, perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of degrees, yet in Iesus Christ <hi>(who hath fulfilled all righteousnesse, who is the Lord our righteousnesse)</hi> hee accepteth of the perfection of parts: prouided there bee withall, first his disposition to sinne, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it power or act, we come short in turning from: so farre as wee know it (and our prayer is for it discouery and endeauour) wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue

And in the next place his disposition vnto the want of grace, as it is sinne present, wee are caried vnto it, as before, liuing by faith in the sonne of GOD for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, remission of that, and all other sinnes, as it is whats required, willing its perfection, desiring it, hungring and thirsting after it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauouring it attainement in the vse of Gods meanes, <hi>praying thy will be done in earth as it is in heauen,</hi> and doing thereafter.</p>

                  </label> If Repentance bee before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, then before iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith: Three I finde in this manner arguing.</p>
               <p>Briefely I deny the consequence. Of Repentance in the sence, I haue out of the Word of God explained it, Turning from sinne, turning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in amendment, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and viuification; two of the
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:176897:202"/>three yeeld the non consequence: and to make that good deny Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Viuification, or tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to God, by amendment, to be the repentant God calleth for; that they confesse a fruit of faith in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: which I suppose in former propositions I haue sufficiently made good.</p>
               <p>The third that maketh this obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction conceiueth rightly of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and includeth, <hi>the loue of GOD aboue all</hi> in it nature. Now to say, that the loue of GOD aboue all is in nature before iustifying faith, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion; so of all sortes confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly absurd, that I neede for the present but to name it. It is sufficient though I say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Whole Sanctification, as well it parts, Mortification, and Viuifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the purging and purifying the heart in this sense, is ordinarily giuen to Faith in Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. and <hi>Collossians</hi> 2. From which
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:176897:202"/>Christ, Faith draweth the same. Faith is of all the Learned confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the roote, the mother of Loue, and all Christian Vertues; and therefore to make it an effect or consequent of them is but nouelty, strange, and vnheard of Doctrine. But of this (if GOD be pleased) an other time.</p>

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:176897:203"/>and turning to God according to all his commaundements, there is the whole <hi>new creature</hi> for parts of grace. Consequently fellowship with Christ, from which this doth flowe: and so faith, by which there is caused that fellowship with Christ; and if it were otherwise, a true repentant might be actually accursed, and it might be possible, that hee dying in the meane time, might goe to hell.</p>
               <p>Which I obserue against those who teach that true repentance, and iustifying faith, may be seperated, the one before the other in time, and others who teach besides, that a man may be <hi>seauen yeares,</hi> more or lesse, truly repentant, and yer vniust, one of the <hi>vngodly, vniustified,</hi> and so without remission of sinnes, and there is a route of those about this Cittie: (which withall conuinceth repentance with them, to bee but legall, indeede <hi>vniustice, vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi> if the tree be naught, the fruit cannot be good.)</p>

Besides, euery one of vs stand vp, and say, <hi>wee beleeue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes,</hi> we begge it often: would you now know whether you hane attained that blessing, whether you are as you professe, free from that terrour and danger spoken of, and so bound for life euerlasting?</p>
               <p>Looke vnto your repentance, Gods condition, examine thy selfe narrowly about that, as I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deliuered it. If thou finde that, thou mayest conclude, and know thy sinnes are remitted. The peace and quiet of thy soule is substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: thy faith and hope of eternall life are liuely, truly conditioned and qualified; thou mayest be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged comfortably to goe on vnto perfection. But if vpon triall it bee otherwise, there is a deniall of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:176897:205"/>spoken of: Thou hast not the forgiuenesse of thy sinnes: thou art not conditioned and qualified vnto the promise of the same: the peace and quiet of soule are but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall security, thy faith and <hi>hope</hi> vaine: <hi>as a Spiders web, as the giuing vp of the Ghost:</hi> Thou hast no title to eternall life, the stipend and <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of those sinnes, is death: repent and bee conuerted for the remission of thy sinnes, except thou repent, thou shalt now, or eternally perish:</hi> repentance is Gods condition to forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes. And so much for this proposition, and GODS whole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script for the plague.</p>

In this Psalme (as one at a non plus) cryeth out: <hi>What shall I render vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord for all his mercies towards mee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The euill of <hi>Dauid,</hi> hath beene lately ours, the euill of the Land, of this Cittie, of this Parish, of euery one of vs abiding in the same: the sorrowes of death compassed vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, the paines of hell got hold vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs; wee found trouble and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, wee were brought lowe, wee were greatly afflicted in this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we called vpon the Lord, wee besought him to deliuer our soules: the Lord was gracious, yea, our God was mercifull; hee hath now won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully deliuered vs; we therefore also owe duty vnto God for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance: the practise of <hi>Dauid</hi> ought to be our paterne, it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our example: Theres not a duty professed and promised by him,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:176897:207"/>but is due from vs. I cannot parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly handle all: out of all I haue chosen one, in the speaking of which I entend to stirre vp my selfe and you, to a proportioned purpose, and resolution, and practise, in these words, <hi>J will walke, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These words containe <hi>Dauids re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution:</hi> they may bee considered two wayes, <hi>absolutely,</hi> or <hi>relatinely; absolutely,</hi> as in themselues: so they containe a <hi>proposition,</hi> in which wee haue: first <hi>the subiect,</hi> in that word <hi>I.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>predicate</hi> in the rest, in which we haue, first an <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in the words, <hi>will walke:</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>manner</hi> of it, <hi>before the Lord:</hi> Thirdly, the circumstance of place, <hi>in the land of the liuing.

            </p>
            <p>In these words, we haue clearely layde downe foure propositions.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:176897:207"/>First, <hi>It is the purpose and practise of Gods people to walke:</hi> 2. <hi>Their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and practise is, to walke before Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah, the Lord.</hi> 3. <hi>Their purpose and practise is, to walke before the Lord in the Land of the liuing.</hi> 4. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerances of GOD vouchsafed vnto Gods people, are preuailing motiues of this purpose, and practise of theirs, to walke before the Lord in the Land of the liuing.</hi> All these are plainly layd downe in the words, and my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is, to speake of them in their order. And first, of the first.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The purpose and practise of Gods people, is to walke.</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Propos. </seg>1</label> In handling this proposition, I will first explaine the words, then proue the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and after put it to vse.</p>
            <p>For explication, <hi>Walke</hi> is a <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,</hi> borrowed from men in a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, their exercise and vse of feete, whereby they tend vnto some place; a course of life, or a life thus and thus led, is called in Scripture a way, liuing and going on in it, walking: as a way, so walking and walkers
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:176897:208"/>are of two sorts or kindes: from the quality the one is called the way of wickednesse, <hi>or the way of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:</hi> The other contrary hereunto, <hi>pathes of righteousnesse,</hi> or the way of the righteous: In regard of the end or terme <hi>ad quem,</hi> the one tendeth to <hi>death,</hi> it is <hi>the broade way, many walke in it:</hi> the other to <hi>life, a narrow way, a fewe finde it, a fewe walke in it.</hi> The former is a going out of the latter way, a turning of the backe vpon God, and his way, a trudging from the same, the latter a turning from the former, a returning vnto the Lord and his wayes. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer denoteth a course, and it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse in sinne, the flux or motion of inward corruption, in thoughts, words, and deedes: the latter, the life of grace, and exercise of it, in thoughts, words, and deedes: the former implieth a power (or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie rather) and expresseth it vse, or exercise, and progresse; the latter, the contrary power, with it vse, as occasion is offered, and progresse,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:176897:208"/>vntill the power and acts are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and the ende fully attained and inioyed. In this place we are not to take it in the former sense: For that a people are open to, and vnder Gods danger; that walke and way leadeth to death: the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of God for auoyding danger, is, <hi>To turne from our euill wayes.</hi> But in the second, the contrary course and trade of life, excercise of grace, and progresse in the same. Thats it which <hi>Dauid</hi> promiseth, and all the godly practise, vnder this notion of walking,</p>
            <p>When as he purposeth walking, it is not to be restrained by one or two graces, their vse, or exercise of them, but it is to bee meant of the vse of all graces: It is layde downe Indefinitly, which is <hi>Aequiualent to vniuersall tearmes.</hi> Though <hi>Dauid</hi> specially promiseth exercise of <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>GOD, gracious, righteous, mercifull,</hi> found and tasted to bee so by comfortable experience, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When as the duty is expressed, we must conceiue, that Gods <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> is also required: vnto which all requisites scattered vp and down in the <hi>Booke of God</hi> are to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

            <p>Add yet, <hi>Dauid</hi> must be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all respects: generally, as a Christian, or childe of GOD:
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:176897:209"/>particularly, or specially, as a <hi>King,</hi> and as a <hi>Prophet;</hi> his profession is in the largest extent to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood: He will walke as a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, in exercise of all grace, towards GOD the Head, and also towards man the rest of that Community. He will walke as a King, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of that Office; as a Prophet, in the administration of that Office.</p>
            <p>The promise of God to <hi>Ely and his Fathers house was, that they should walke before him for euer:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2.30</note>
               <hi>and honour him in the administration of that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiice,</hi> And so are the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> said to walke, in regard of the administration of that Office: And so must we conceiue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, infolding exercise of all grace, as Christians, as Kings, as Ministers, as People, as Husbands, as Wiues, as Parents, as Children, as Masters, as Seruants. And thus is it the purpose and practise of Gods people to walke.</p>
            <p>For proofe:
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Proofe. </seg>
               </label> I might bee large in
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:176897:210"/>instance: It was the cōmendation of <hi>Enoch He walked with God:</hi> of <hi>Noah that Preacher of righteousnes.</hi> Of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> &amp; <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Of that renowned paire, <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, They were both iust before God, and walked in all the commandements &amp; ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God:</hi> Commandements, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; First in Commandements, then in Ordinances, in both, in all.</p>
            <p>There is good reason for it:</p>
            <p>First,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> It is Gods expresse Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
<note place="margin">Gen. 17.1.</note>
               <hi>Walke before me and be vpright,</hi> saith God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his seede, <hi>Genes.</hi> 17.21. And it is worthy our consideration, to take notice of the particular graces and their exercise, called for vnder this notion of walking, in these phrases: <hi>Walking in the spirit, after the spirit, in the Law of God, by faith, in loue, in truth, in the feare of God, in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life:</hi> vnto which wee may referre precepts about the manner in the places named before.

            <p n="2">2 <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> Because these are a company

               <hi>to Christ, and fellowship with him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. From whence as their is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth life, and a power of grace, so inablement to it vse and exercise in walking. And thus doth God enter into couenant with vs, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quute the former promise: and therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> beseecheth the <hi>Ephesians, To walke worthy the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wherewith they were called, Eph.</hi> 4.1. And worthyly, because that walking is an <hi>inseparable effect</hi> of this calling: when as the Prophet had said, <hi>He</hi> (Christ) <hi>shall call a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:176897:211"/>it is added, <hi>and they shall runne vnto him, Isai.</hi> 55.5. Effectuall call inableth a man to answere the same, conformeth a man to that he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto; it planteth or setteth a man into Christ, and conformeth him to <hi>Christ,</hi> to his <hi>death,</hi> Whence followeth, <hi>We</hi> (in regard of the old man) <hi>are dead with him, to his buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> Whence it inseperably follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>we are buried with him:</hi> the old man is laid in a consumption, as a carkase in a graue, <hi>To his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that like as Christ dyed, and rose againe from the dead, by the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Father, so wee should walke in newnesse of life, Rom.</hi> 6.4. Hence those that are in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> are called <hi>walkers not after the flesh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note>
               <hi>but after the spirit. Hee that abideth in him, ought to walke, as he hath walked,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.6. By effectuall call vnto Christ we are made <hi>newe creatures,</hi>

               <hi>which he hath enclined, that we should walke in.</hi> Good workes are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for vs to walke in, and we crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to walke in Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to doe good workes: so that we being a company, <hi>called to Iesus Christ;</hi> from hence haue this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and practise, to walke.</p>
            <p>Last of all,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>3</label> the priuiledges giuen vnto Gods people, necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that they walke, they are a people that haue obtained mercie in remission and pardon of sinnes: <hi>there is no condemnation vnto them;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> they haue hope of eternall life and glory: they are <hi>begotten againe vnto a liuely hope of an inheritance, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and vndefiled, that fadeth not away,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. None of all which can be made good, can bee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished vnto that man that doth not purpose and practise this duty of walking: walking is a complement, necessarily disposing the soule to these blessings.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Salomon</hi> describeth the <hi>Lord, keeping couenant, and shewing
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:176897:212"/>mercie,</hi> but to whom? <hi>seruants:</hi> and what seruants? <hi>That walke before thee with all their hearts,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.16. And when the Apostle had said, <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus;</hi> hee sheweth who those are, describing them by this, as another effect of their being in Christ, <hi>which walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</hi> Howsoeuer good workes are not the causes of raigning, yet they are the way, or <hi>causa sine qua non, God hath ordained them, that wee should walke in them vnto heauen:</hi> the man that walketh not in them, shall neuer attaine Gods Kingdome; and therefore, there is a necessity of this walking, of this purpose and practise in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry childe of God.</p>
            <p>The vse I make of it,
<label type="milestone">

            <p>Is it so then, that we looking into our selues, can finde this purpose and practise of walking, that we are men walking after the Spirit, by it conduct; in the truth, in faith, in loue, in the feare of GOD, in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

            <p>Then may we gather, wee are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede Gods people: wee may make our calling, our fellowship with Christ, our confederacie with God sure, we may make good all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges annexed, that there is no condemnation vnto vs, the mercy of God, his keeping of couenants to eternall life, and glory, with all good: Thou art a man qualified, all the promises of God are made vnto thee, vnto thee belong these signes and seales; the scope of the Lord is, to make faith by them vnto thee, of
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:176897:213"/>his bounty in Iesus Christ, against all questions, and doubts, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations within thy soule arising to the contrary, to communicate himselfe, and his Christ vnto thee more and more, and in him to open vnto thee all his treasures: thou art an inuited guest, thou mayest eate and drinke boldly, as thou receiuest Iesus Christ, the Lord, walke on in him, rooted and grounded, and built vp in thy faith: bee encouraged to goe on; come as often as Gods ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is laid, vntill thou attaine Christ and God vnto perfect vnion: bee holy yet, bee righteous yet, cast off euery thing that may hinder thee: presse forward daily towards the marke; <hi>Be constant and immoueable, alwayes abounding in the workes of the Lord,</hi> assuredly <hi>thy labour shall not be in vaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if vpon examination and triall, this is not to be found, thou hast not this power and it vse, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the will, nor yet the deede. (I meane to walke in Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,

Walke in his commandements. This is the way, walke in it. Search we, and trie our wayes, and turne vnto the

            <p>Consider the end; thats good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, that hath a good end; the end of the wayes of GOD, is life, euerlasting life; the end of other wayes death, euerlasting death; <hi>life and death are set before thee this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider, this was thy first vowe in Baptisme; there diddest thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all other wayes, and promise this, pay thy vowes. Let the time that is past, spent in by pathes, bee sufficient: let it shame thee that wicked men are, that thy selfe art more nimble in thy course to hell then heauen. <hi>Redeeme that time;</hi> as thou hast serued sinne, serue the Lord.</p>
            <p>Consider thy present profession is Christianity, that thou art a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that Church, called to fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with Christ, that thou art a childe of light, that thou art an honest man, thus art thou in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; wouldest bee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged

            </p>
            <p>Consider if thou walkest on in sinne, thy walke is contrary to God, <hi>and God will walke contrary vnto thee;</hi> he will crosse and curse thee in all thy proceedings: vnto the euils inflicted he will adde seuen times so many more, many times seuen times so many more vnto desolation: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the euils written, threatned, hee will adde such as are <hi>not written.</hi> Trust not in lying words, <hi>Peace, peace, I shall haue peace though I walke, &amp;c. Theres no peace vnto the wicked, the wrath and iealousie of the Lord shall waxe hott against thee, the Lord shall separate thee to euill.</hi> Hee
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:176897:216"/>will deale with thee as with the <hi>men of Sodome and Gomorrah, Deut.</hi> 29.19.20. <hi>Whilest thou shalt cry, peace and safety, destruction, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den destruction stall come vpon thee as trauell vpon a woman, and thou shalt not escape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider it is one speciall meanes of preuailing against the enemies of Gods Church, a mercy wee doe stand in neede of at this present. <hi>O that Jsrael had walked in my wayes, J should soone haue subdued their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and turned mine hand against their aduersaries.

            <p>Finally, thou hast no part nor portion in this businesse in hand, the Supper of the Lord: thou wast not
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:176897:216"/>inuited, the table was not spread for thee, nor these fatte things prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: it is <hi>childrens meate,</hi> thou <hi>a Dogge;</hi> an holy thing, such <hi>may not be giuen to Dogges;</hi> a pearle, they <hi>may not bee cast before swine:</hi> thou art indeed <hi>without God and Christ,</hi> and that <hi>Couenant,</hi> and the <hi>Promise,</hi> in a desperate case if thou commest, without hope of it good, thou hast not thy complement, thy qualitie, <hi>worthynes, the wedding garment. If thou eate and drinke vnworthily, thou art guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord; thou eatest iudgement:</hi> Gods children not renewing that coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of walking, comming and eating, eate iudgement. What shall become of thee? What shall be done to thee? Thou shalt eate damnation. <hi>The Cupp of blessing which we blesse, Is it not Communion of the blood of Christ? The Bread which we breake, is it not the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Body of Christ?</hi> All know it. And withall that there is <hi>no agreement betweene God and Belial,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:176897:217"/>betweene light and darkenes. Jf we say, we haue fellowship with him, and walke in darkenesse, we lye, and doe not the truth. Hee</hi> that sayth, <hi>hee abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in him, ought to walke as he hath walked.</hi> All these belong to Gods people, <hi>whose purpose and practise it is to walke.

An high priuiledge and fauour (if wee sawe it, if wee but clearely knew it.)

How much greater is it to bee the seruants of the King of Kings? how much more happy a thing to doe seruice to God before him? to bee his Ministers, seruants, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to beare his bread, and his cup; to draw neere vnto him in prayer, and other his ordinances, in publique and priuate, daily to come before him and appeare. What an inducement is this, to draw vs to Gods seruice? vs, ours, <hi>I and mine houshold will serue the Lord.</hi> Nature flyeth Gods presence, as <hi>Adam:</hi> it is the greatest misery of naturall men, they feare it; the world seeth it not, deride that seruice as <hi>Michol,</hi> and yet it is before the

            <p>Againe, it is very comfortable, in regard of the good wee doe, wee will, we purpose, to God, to man: thoughts, wishes, desires, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, words, deedes, prayers, teares, are all before God: our workes and labours of loue, are all in his sight: what matter if no eye else in the world see them: if I haue no other witnes, if others see not, know not, denie mine actions, slander me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie me, beare false witnesse against me, iudge me, condemne me: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science acquiting, giueth great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; it is as a brasen wall; <hi>It is a continuall feast, Gods witnesse</hi> and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie, by eye and presence <hi>is

            <p>When is the soule of a childe of God more composed, bent, set for the seruice of God, then when it is sensibly in the presence of GOD: walking, and before God, are euer conioyned.

            <p>The liuing can put euery occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vnto a good vse, make it an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of his glorifying God and owne edification:

            <p>Conuiction of many, because they haue neither purpose, nor practise of walking before the Lord, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer their purpose bee in another world, it seemeth they haue had none to walke with God here in the land of the liuing. The time that is past, hath beene spent indeede in
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:176897:224"/>walking, and it hath beene in the eye &amp; sight of God, God hath seene it (though hee be silent) but it hath beene <hi>after the course of the world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prince of darknesse, after their owne vngodly lusts.</hi> In all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of sinnes, they haue not walked one step in the lawes and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, they haue not as much as a purpose to walke, the purpose they seeme to haue, is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, caused by some extremity fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or felt temporarie, for the day of trouble onely, in a death or sicke bed: Whilst <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is vnder the plague, and whilst <hi>Herods</hi> eare is tickled by the sweet sound of the preaching of <hi>Iohn.</hi> There is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of motion: repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is a turning from sin, &amp; a turning to God, is put off, their purpose is to reforme and amend hereafter, possibly in another life. <hi>Yet a little sleepe, yet a little slumber, yet a little folding of the armes.</hi> How punctuall &amp; precise so euer men are with men, and stand vpon it, in
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:176897:224"/>keeping day, they ordinarily breake with GOD. The truth is, there is small hope of many in this world, custome in sinne is added to nature, as another nature, they are by it as Leopards in regard of spots, as black Mores, in regard of their skin, they cannot change: they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curse of God, giuen ouer, by God, giuen vp: the curse is past already vpon many vnproficients, vnder rich meanes, <hi>neuer grow fruit vpon thee more.</hi> Whatsoeuer that be, leaue it as a secret not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to vs: let it onely bee feared, and prouoke to holy iealousie.

Whatsoeuer thou mayest be, I leaue it as a secret to God, for the present, thou art none of that company.

            </p>
            <p>Consider this you that forget God: take time and day no longer, trifle not with the Lord any more:
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:176897:225"/>consider times are not in your hands or power: <hi>When you say you will, what is your life but a vapour, as a bubble that passeth away?</hi> Whats past, yesterday, is gone, it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called: whats to come is the Lords, the onely present point of time, is ours, and therefore if euer yee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to walke, take the season, make vse of oportunity, <hi>Seeke the Lord while hee may be found: call vpon him whilst he is neere: whilst thou hast the light walke, as a childe of light before God: whilst it is called to day harden not your hearts.</hi> Now thou hast the word, and God, in his workes, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon thee; thou hast all thy sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, whatsoeuer is in thine heart, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, wishes thou mayest doe, and onely now, let slip this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thou mayest neuer haue another: how often doth the Lord threaten suddaine destruction? how suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth it come vpon many?

God deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his soule from hell, his eies from teares, his feet from falling; and therefore he resolueth, I will walke. It is the maine scope of <hi>Dauid,</hi> in this Psalme, (as we heard in it reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.)</p>
            <p>And there is great reason for it.</p>
            <p>First,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> Because it is that which the Lord requireth, as homage, it is our gratitude, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:176897:227"/>out the Scriptures repeated: the reason is alike to them and vs from that deliuerance, and the like; and therefore,</p>
            <p>This is Gods ende and ayme in our deliueraces,

<note place="margin">Luk. 1.75.</note>
               <hi>That we being deliuered out of the hands of all our enemies, should serue God in holinesse and righteousse, before him all the dayes of our liues.</hi> Which is all one with walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in the Land of the liuing: <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble,</hi>

               <hi>I will deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi> It is as we see the Lords Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Last of all,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>3</label> it is but iust and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall. It is that which is couenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for, promised and vowed: Not a villaine in the world, but in sight and sense of danger will promise this, I am sure Gods people doe: What more equall then to performe couenant, and to pay vowes?</p>
            <p>It is that whereby life is giuen
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:176897:227"/>vnto vs, it is no more then that which is giuen, then that which is receiued of the Lord: It is iust and equall to call for that, for any base and slauish imployment, and it is lesse then life, the kindnesse wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue: how much more when as it is to be imployed in the seruice of God? <hi>Gods seruice is perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> glory was, <hi>James a seruant, Paul a seruant. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> that King, his glory, <hi>J am thy seruant, I am thy seruant.</hi> Angells themselues, <hi>I am thy fellow-seruant, and a fellow-seruant of the brethren.</hi> And therefore the reason is good, iust, equall, that this should bee a motiue of such a purpose, and such a practise. Let vs put this also to vse.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The vse shall bee <hi>Examination</hi> and <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Examination,

<pb n="426" facs="tcp:176897:228"/>euery particular man and woman.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but <hi>the Lord hath done great things for vs: he hath commanded for vs many deliuerances.</hi> In that memorable yeare 1588. we had a strange deliuerance. In the yeare 1605. from the <hi>Popish, hellish, deuillish, neuer to bee forgotten Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder treason,</hi> a miraculous deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. It is not long since the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Feauer,</hi> destroying messengers of God were amongst vs: our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was deliuered, our selues esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; particular deliuerances of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are infinite, wee should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer make an end of telling them.</p>
            <p>Not long since, the now <hi>breath of our nostrils</hi> was not, was in a strange land, <hi>Egipt;</hi> wee haue receiued him, and now enioy him, by Gods hand deliuered, quitted from <hi>Egipt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long since our land, as <hi>Egipt</hi> once (in another kinde) was annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Frogges, Priests, Iesuites, (a plague worse then that of Frogs in <hi>Egipt</hi>) they crawled vp &amp; down;
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:176897:228"/>the insolencie of their creatures must neuer be forgotten: They had fire and faggot (their olde weapons) in their mouthes: we may imagine they had the same, and much more in their hearts. In a good measure we are deliuered, by proclamation they are swept away, and shall be by timely execution (if our sinnes still hinder not) which the Lord GOD speedily graunt vs.</p>
            <p>Lately, the Lord had crowned the earth with grasse and corne, the Lord in his cloudes did frowne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, and yet the Lord was entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that fearefull storme was then blowne ouer.</p>
            <p>Not long since, the Lord shewed hee had another controuersie with vs for our sinnes: Iudgement was not executed, and the Lord sent an extraordinary messenger to that end, the pestilence. It did that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with a witnesse, in the Cittie, in the Country, in our whole Land: What Parish amongst vs was there not infected? what house or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:176897:229"/>person free, at least from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger? The receiued sum of those that died by this hand in the Cittie and places adiacent, is 41313. and the Lord doth know how many hundreds more, the streights of those times are fresh in our memories: Many of vs recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the sentence of death being stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: all of vs did tremble and feare: our liues were alwaies in our hands: the desolation of this famous Cittie was great: whilst many forsooke it, (barbarously entertained by the Country) whilst most houses spued out more or lesse, of their late Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants?</p>
            <p>Who can expresse our lamentable complaints?</p>
            <p>With the Prophet here wee may say, that <hi>the sorrowes of hell compassed vs about, we found trouble and sorrow, wee were brought very lowe, wee were greatly afflicted:</hi> when as on the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth</hi> or Fast dayes, wee came from Gods house: our feare was, wee should neuer see the <hi>Lord</hi> againe in
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:176897:229"/>his house, <hi>euen the Lord in this land of the liuing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this great straight of ours, we called vpon the name of the Lord, wee earnestly besought him to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our soules, those and the like voyces: let my soule liue, let our liues be pretious in thine eyes, were often in our mouthes: the Lord enclined his eare vnto vs, <hi>heard the voyce of our supplication: gracious was the Lord and righteous: yea, our God was mercifull, hee preserued vs,</hi> he deliuered vs; <hi>he deliuered vs from the snare of the fowler, and from the noysome pestilence: hee did couer vs with his feathers, and vnder his wings we were safe; a thousand did fall at our side, and ten thousand at our right hand, it did not come nigh vs: onely with our eyes did we behold, there was no euill</hi> (truly so) <hi>that did befall vs,</hi> the plague did not, or but come <hi>neere some of our dwellings: hee gaue his Angels charge ouer vs, and they did keepe vs in all our wayes, because he set his loue vpon vs, therefore did
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:176897:230"/>he deliuer vs: with life did hee satisfie vs, and shew vs his saluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>None of these deliuerances can be denied. Haue we by holy walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before God, in the land of the liuing, answered in purpose and practise all these deliuerances? to passe by all the former (the thing it selfe speaketh, wee haue not beene answerable to former deliuerances, had he had his end, we had neuer had so great an hand, so fearefull a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger as this plague sent against vs) haue wee that are all aliue this day, <hi>brands pluckt out of the fire,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, (in second causes) appointed to die, answered the Lord: haue we had <hi>Dauids</hi> profession, purpose, and practise? Haue wee of all sorts, Magistrates, Ministers, Masters of Families, particulars, vpon this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to loue GOD, to call vpon God, to giue thanks to GOD, to pay our vowes to GOD, to walke before the Lord in the land of the liuing, to serue the Lord in holinesse and righteousnesse, before him all
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:176897:230"/>the dayes of our liues: Such of vs as were wicked men before, liuing in trades of sinne, haue wee vpon this motiue, this deliuerance, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from our euill wayes: entred into the pathes of righteousnesse: Haue wee (before entred) mended our pace, walked on in the same, growne in resolution, endeuour and practise? If I, let it be an euidence vnto thee, that thou art of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gods people; because they are deliuered, they resolue and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise this duty of walking before the Lord, in the land of the liuing.</p>
            <p>But if vpon examination it bee found otherwise with some of vs, thus euery way deliuered. (And alas it is so with the most of all sorts, the sinnes spoken of before, causing and calling for the plague, abide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs: the defects, and wants, omissions, are as many as before; positiue sinnes or commissions are as many as they were before; the man is hardly found that liued in a trade of sinne before, that now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth

            </p>
            <p>If vpon examination it be found thus with vs, bee it knowne vnto
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:176897:231"/>that man and woman, his religion and profession of the same is vaine: thou art none of the people of God, thou wantest this strong euidence of it: they deliuered; resolue, and practise walking before the Lord. <hi>Repent, repent</hi> of thy dead workes, of this dead worke, thy not answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable walking. Is this cursed life of thine that thou promisedst vnto the Lord, in trouble? Is it propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to thy deliuerance? Did God spare thee for this? Did God giue thee thy life for this? Doest thou thus reward the Lord? Thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by God for this sinne: bee conuinced of it, bee ashamed and confounded for the same, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confesse it vnto GOD: iudge and condemne thy selfe for this sinne: forsake it; neuer leaue vntill thou hast gotten of the Lord in the vse of meanes, a power to walke before GOD, the will and deede, that purpose and practise. And to moue you, remember that fearefull iudgement which was of
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:176897:232"/>late vpon you, the plague: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Londons</hi> desolation, the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in houses, in streetes, the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Churchyards, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of poore &amp; rich, for friends, for seruants, for children, for hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, for wiues, for Ministers; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten recount those times, let the scarres in thy selfe or thine put thee in remembrance, and preuaile with thee. Let our strange and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deliuerance from that hand, and Gods rich mercy in it perswade thee.</p>
            <p>Consider and know, if thou doe not, thou hast to deale with the Lord: thy sinnes euen this, is still noted in his booke, thou art still within his reach, and open to his danger, there is no going for thee from his presence: the world and particular place of thine aboad, is but the prison of the Lord, from whence at his pleasure he can drag thee to execution: the Lord hath more rods and scourges, he can send famine, he can send the sword, and
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:176897:232"/>giue vs ouer vnto the will of our aduersaries. Hee can returne in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with the same iudgement, the pestilence: former deliuerances ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt not a people vnworthy from future iudgements and plagues: <hi>Of Israel</hi> it is said, <hi>that after the Lord deliuered them out of the land of Egipt, hee did destroy them that did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, Iud.</hi> How many recouering of the Flux and Feauer haue beene swept away by the plague? that escaped in former times, the plague, and now by it are gone to their long home?

Doth not the Lord by this messenger houer ouer vs, and continue about vs, as if hee would tell vs for our vnthankfulnesse, hee meaneth some such thing? If thou doe not, know that thy purposes, and promises, and vowes before were hypocritcall and feigned: thy deliuerance was not in mercy, but
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:176897:233"/>iustice rather: Had God cut thee off before (impenitently now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuering) thy sinnes had beene lesse, so had thy condemnation: it is his iust iudgement vpon thee, <hi>to smite thee no more:</hi> hee leaueth thee to thy selfe, as the beast is, <hi>for a day of slaughter, after the hardnesse of thine heart, that cannot repent, thou heapest vp wrath against a day of wrath, and the reuelation of the righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of GOD.</hi> Consider this yee that forget GOD, sowe for better things, bee not so cruell to your owne soules; doe not in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner reward the Lord. And yet if thou art of another minde, another purpose, another practise; walke on, <hi>follow the lust of thine owne heart, and the pleasures of thine owne eyes, thou that art filthy, bee so still: thou that art vnrighteous, bee so still: fill vp the measure of thine iniquity, and yet for all that, know that for all these things thou shalt come vnto iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for vs, let it be otherwise, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:176897:233"/>the Lord hath deliuered vs: let vs purpose and practise with <hi>Dauid,</hi> let vs pay our vowes, the vowes of our trouble, in the congregation, in all places; let vs walke before the Lord: God calleth for it, our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are infinite: This memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deliuerance must preuaile: Let the plague it selfe, as the Sermon of <hi>Peter,</hi> win to GOD some thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands: let this deliuerance prouoke more. The day, and time, the first day of the new yeare calleth on vs, the former part mispent is enough, and too much: Let vs spend no more in that manner. Let vs passe all the rest in walking before God, in newnesse of life. In baptisme we vowed it, and renewed it as often as we haue beene at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. This day wee haue beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed with the Lords Supper. In it (notwithstanding all our sinnes) God hath renued his couenant with vs; In and through <hi>Iesus Christ, and the blood of the couenant,</hi> communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs that are worthy: Hee
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:176897:234"/>hath appeared by <hi>the name of GOD Almighty,</hi> by all other holy names and attributes relatiue, to bee vnto <hi>vs a God:</hi> he hath condiscended to our infi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mities, and vnto his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses written, added this signe and this seale: hee hath made faith to vs of remission of sinnes, of eternall life, of all good. <hi>His couenant is an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting couenant, his mercies sure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In it wee haue likewise renewed our couenant with the Lord, wee haue once more promised &amp; sworne alleageance, we haue giuen GOD our signe and our seale. If we looke for comfort from the Lord, let vs purpose and practise our promise: comfort and obedience are conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God, no man can put them assunder. The thing the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, and we promise (if wee be the Lords) wee shall bee enabled to performe, it is one of his legacies; both are the purchase of the death of Christ, with whom wee haue had communion this day, and in whom
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:176897:234"/>we haue receiued fresh power, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue and practise this duty: by which we may know that wee haue beene disposed Communicants, and that wee are thankfull rememberers of the Lord.</p>
            <p>If one deliuerance bee such a ground: what are all our deliueran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together? If this deliuerance of our land from the <hi>plague:</hi> what is that of <hi>England,</hi> from the <hi>seruice of stockes, and stones, and workes of mens hands, of creatures, from more then Egiptian darknesse from slauery</hi> (whilst <hi>England</hi> was <hi>heathenish,</hi> whilst <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled</hi> to <hi>Egipt, and Sodome, Rome?</hi> What is the deliuerance of Gods people from <hi>the power of sinne and Sathan, the power of darknesse, from this vngodly and wicked present world,</hi> from hell and the graue? What is <hi>our saluation</hi> promised, purchased, vndertaken begun from all our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesses? What is our <hi>redemption out</hi> of the hands of all our enemies? All these adde waight vnto that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and call aloude on vs who haue
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:176897:235"/>that faith, and hope, for seruice of God, in holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the dayes of our lines. <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, thus visiting and redeeming his people, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vp vnto vs such an horne of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Because thou hast deliuered our soules from hell, our eyes from teares, our feete from falling. Wee will walke before the Lord in the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Now the great Sheepheard of his Sheepe, CHRIST JESVS, in the blood of his euerlasting couenant, make vs all perfect to doe his will, and worke in vs whatsoeuer is pleasing in his sight, through Iesus Christ: to whom be all glorie and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion for euer.</hi>
